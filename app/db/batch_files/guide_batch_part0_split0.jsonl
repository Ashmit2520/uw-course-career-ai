Human Rights and Humanitarianism\nalso encompasses the organizations and institutions that work to protect\nand advocate for these rights, inclusive of courses on international law,\nnonprofit management, and non-state actors in global politics as well as\nthose on specialized multilateral organizations that deal with human rights,\nsuch as regional organizations and specialized agencies at the United\nNations. The named option similarly addresses social movements for\nchange. It addresses the ways in which civilians are protected when thrust\ninto conditions of hardship, including the laws of war, regimes on migration\nand forced migration, and efforts to address global health disparities.\nGLOBAL SECURITY\nThis named option covers traditional and non-traditional forms of\ninsecurity, disorder, and violent conflict as well as efforts to resolve\nand manage conflict. The thematic categories include forms of war,\nincluding interstate and civil war, as well as forms of political violence\nagainst civilians, such as terrorism, genocide, riots, and massacres.\nGlobal Security also covers non-traditional forms of insecurity, such as\nclimate change, biothreats, pandemics and other infectious diseases,\ncyberattacks and cybersecurity, and food security.

While\nstudy abroad is not a requirement for the major, all International Studies\nstudents are strongly encouraged to pursue a significant international\nexperience during the course of the undergraduate career. Whether\nthrough a study abroad program, an internship, or service learning,\nthe experience of studying or working in a foreign culture is invaluable.\nMany courses taken abroad will count toward the International Studies\nmajor.

This excludes INTL ST\ncourses and courses cross-listed in INTL ST.\u00a0For example: A student\nwith five POLI SCI courses that could apply to the major will see only\nfour of those courses applying in the International Studies major.\n(However, if one of those POLI SCI courses is also cross-listed in INTL\nST, that course will not count against the limit, and thus, all five POLI SCI\ncourses will apply in the major.) The degree audit (DARS) enforces this\nlimitation.\nThough some courses are identified as acceptable for two or more\nrequirements, a course may meet only one requirement within the\nmajor.\u00a0For example, a course that could count in either Option Core or\nOption Issues will meet only one of those requirements, based on which\nrequirement needs that course to become satisfied. The degree audit\n(DARS) determines the best scenario.\n2 Major courses designated Intermediate and Advanced level are\nconsidered upper-level.\n3 A maximum of two courses and 8 credits from UW\u2013Madison Study\nAbroad may apply to this requirement.\nUNIVERSITY DEGREE\nREQUIREMENTS\nTotal Degree\nTo receive a bachelor's degree from UW\u2013Madison,\nstudents must earn a minimum of 120 degree credits.\nThe requirements for some programs may exceed 120\ndegree credits. Students should consult with their college\nor department advisor for information on specific credit\nrequirements.\nResidency\nDegree candidates are required to earn a minimum of\n30 credits in residence at UW\u2013Madison. \"In residence\"\nmeans on the UW\u2013Madison campus with an undergraduate\ndegree classification. \u201cIn residence\u201d credit also includes\nUW\u2013Madison courses offered in distance or online formats\nand credits earned in UW\u2013Madison Study Abroad/Study\nAway programs.\nQuality of\nWork\nUndergraduate students must maintain the minimum grade\npoint average specified by the school, college, or academic\nprogram to remain in good academic standing. Students\nwhose academic performance drops below these minimum\nthresholds will be placed on academic probation.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n1. (Interdisciplinarity) analyzing contemporary political, economic,\nsecurity and cultural realities globally from multi-disciplinary\nperspectives, ideally including humanities, social sciences,\nhumanitarian, and sometimes natural science approaches.\n2. (Depth of knowledge) mastering at the undergraduate generalist\nlevel major issues related to key themes in International Studies (e.g.\nculture, global security and political economy) by taking 15 credits in\none particular theme area.\n3. (Regional (studies) grounding) understanding the social, political,\neconomic and cultural forces and conditions that have given rise to the\nunity and diversity of a specific region of the world today.\n4. (Language knowledge) mastering at the undergraduate generalist\nlevel a particular facet of life in one or more region of the world by\nstudying a language to at least the advanced (5th semester) level.\n5. (Analytical skills) demonstrating the ability to think critically and\nanalytically, the capacity to write clearly and effectively, and the ability\nto identify and evaluate research methods and outcomes.\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nThis Four-Year Plan is only one way a student may complete an L&S\ndegree with this major. Many factors can affect student degree planning,\nincluding placement scores, credit for transferred courses, credits earned\nby examination, and individual scholarly interests. In addition, many\nstudents have commitments (e.g., athletics, honors, research, student\norganizations, study abroad, work and volunteer experiences) that\nnecessitate they adjust their plans accordingly.

I love that I can take classes that are more science-y in\naddition to critical thinking and analytical writing. The diverse perspectives\nI've encountered in my courses have made being a certificate student all\nthe more enjoyable. I know the work I've done with this program will stay\nwith me in the years to come.\" Sally Conroy (ILS Graduate)\n\u201cI love that the history and literature I learn in my ILS courses makes me a\nbetter conversationalist.\u201d Paul Sutherland (ILS graduate)\n\u201cI love ILS because there is so much to learn. \u00a0Through ILS I was able\nto trace the history of science from natural philosophy all the way up\nto Newtonian physics, and the impact of science on the contemporary\nart & literature. \u00a0I really enjoyed being able to study the humanities, and\nthe insights these classes have provided me on the interaction between\nscience and culture. \u00a0The program was a great way for me to study things\nthat I am interested in, but are unrelated to my major, such as astronomy,\ngeology, philosophy, literature, art history, geopolitics.\u201d\u00a0 Brad Glasco (ILS\ngraduate)\n\u201cThe main goal of ILS is to get its students to recognize how\u00a0different\nsubjects of knowledge connect with one another.

Demonstrate practical skills of a professional biologist including:\nproblem#solving by engaging the process of science; written and\nverbal proficiency; laboratory skills; quantitative analysis skills; and\nteamwork skills.\n3. Graduates will be able to engage and make broader connections to\nother scientific disciplines and society.\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nThis Four-Year Plan is only one way a student may complete an L&S\ndegree with this major. Many factors can affect student degree planning,\nincluding placement scores, credit for transferred courses, credits earned\nby examination, and individual scholarly interests. In addition, many\nstudents have commitments (e.g., athletics, honors, research, student\norganizations, study abroad, work and volunteer experiences) that\nnecessitate they adjust their plans accordingly. Informed students engage\nin their own unique Wisconsin Experience by consulting their academic\nadvisors, Guide, DARS, and Course Search & Enroll for assistance making\nand adjusting their plan.\nFour-year Plans for the Biology major are designed to support biological\nscience major exploration and planning your academic career. Your\nspecific program of study could, and probably will, look different. You\nshould customize the Four-Year Plan to fit your unique interests at UW\u2013\nMadison. Consult with your advisor about the best plan for you.\nSAMPLE BIOLOGY MAJOR FOUR-YEAR\nPLAN\nFreshman\nFall\nCredits Spring\nCredits\nCHEM\u00a0103\n4 CHEM\u00a0104\n5\nMATH\u00a02211\n5 STAT\u00a03711\n3\nCommunication A\n3 Literature Breadth\n3\nSocial Science Breadth\n3 Ethnic Studies/Social\nScience Breadth\n4\n\u00a0\n15 \u00a0\n15\nSophomore\nFall\nCredits Spring\nCredits\nBIOLOGY/BOTANY/\nZOOLOGY\u00a0\u00a01512\n5 BIOLOGY/BOTANY/\nZOOLOGY\u00a0\u00a01522\n5\nCHEM\u00a0343\n3 CHEM\u00a0344\n2\nLiterature Breadth\n3 CHEM\u00a0345\n3\nSocial Science Breadth\n3 Humanities Breadth\n3\nINTER-LS\u00a0210\n1 Elective\n2\n\u00a0\n15 \u00a0\n15", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

Since there is no evolutionary biology major available at UW\u2013\nMadison, this is the only mechanism to indicate specialization in this\nrapidly growing and popular field. In taking this named option, students\nwill be able to fulfill their intermediate/advanced biology requirement\nwith courses that emphasize evolutionary biology, ranging from required\ncourses in fundamental evolutionary biology to more advanced optional\ncourses that cover a wide range of evolutionary biology topics.

It is expected that undergraduates with a major in\nLinguistics will be able to:\n\u2022 demonstrate a sound knowledge of the fields of phonetics\n(articulatory and acoustic properties of speech), phonology (the\norganization of the sound system of languages), morphology\n(the structure of words), syntax (the structure of sentences), and\nsemantics (the interpretation of structures);\n\u2022 demonstrate that they are able to analyze data in all these areas of\nlinguistics;\n\u2022 apply their linguistic training without prejudice, as expected in any\nscience; and\n\u2022 apply their analytical abilities beyond the study of linguistics.\nThe Linguistics major emphasizes strong foundational training in the core\nareas of theoretical linguistics. Students also have access to elective\ncourses (https://langsci.wisc.edu/electives-in-the-major/) in a wide\nvariety of interdisciplinary areas, including first and second language\nacquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, language and data\nscience, historical linguistics, neurolinguistics, and indigenous language\ndocumentation and revitalization. Coursework is also available in the\nlinguistics of specific languages or language families, such as American\nSign Language (https://langsci.wisc.edu/asl/), Germanic, Spanish and\nRomance, Chinese, Japanese, and Native American linguistics.\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nRequirements\nDetails\nHow to get in\nNo application required.

As such, there is not a four-year plan for this program.\nPlease refer to the\u00a0Requirements\u00a0tab for more information about the\ncurriculum and program plan.\nADVISING AND CAREERS\nADVISING AND CAREERS\nADVISING\nEach UW-Madison Online student is assigned an academic and career\n(AC) advisor (https://oss.wisc.edu/about-us/).\nCAREERS\nCompletion of the BLS+MASS complements many career paths.\nCoursework designed around a liberal arts education provides\nstudents with critical thinking, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and\ncommunication skills needed in all industries. A focused study of social\nsciences helps graduates understand:\n\u2022 how the social world can be understood and explored in a structured\nand guided way; and\n\u2022 how the tools used in the study of the social world can help identify\nissues that need attention and problems that could be solved.\nActive engagement in the career development process is a vital\ncomponent of a student\u2019s personal growth in college and future success\nas a lifelong learner, professional, and global citizen. Advisors help prepare\nstudents for life post-graduation through individual and group advising.\nBIOCHEMISTRY, BA (L&S)\nBiochemistry is a very broad science that studies the molecules and\nchemistry of life. Biochemistry focuses on the structure, properties, and\ninteractions of molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, sugars and lipids.\nBiochemistry\u2019s aim is to understand how these molecules participate in\nthe processes that support the various functions of the living cell. These\nstudies are therefore essential for understanding disease and finding\ncures, for improving agriculture and the production of food and biofuels,\nand to produce innovation in biotechnology.\nWhereas other biological science majors may focus on cellular, organismal,\nor population-level biology, biochemistry focuses on processes that occur\nat the molecular to cellular levels. Therefore, this major has a greater focus\non basic and quantitative sciences, such as math and, particularly, on\nchemistry.\nBiochemistry graduates go on to a variety of careers in science and\nscience-related fields. The major is designed to fit the needs of the\nstudent who wishes to achieve bachelor\u2019s-level training as well as those\nplanning to pursue graduate or professional study. The degree serves as\nan excellent background for medical school or veterinary school admission,\nas well as for graduate study in biochemistry or other allied fields (biology,\nbacteriology, genetics, molecular biology, or oncology).\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nStudents may declare the major via an appointment with the\nundergraduate advisor at any time.\nThe Biochemistry major is offered through either CALS or the College\nof Letters & Science (L&S).

Microorganisms, or microbes, were the first life\nforms on Earth and influence our lives and our planet in innumerable ways.\nThe field of microbiology is constantly expanding as we learn more about\nthe role of microbes in infectious disease, environmental remediation,\nbioenergy, food safety, antibiotic resistance, biotechnology, and much\nmore. Communities of microbes (or \"microbiomes\") are critically important\nin human health, global warming, agricultural yield, criminal justice,\neconomic development, and other issues of national concern.\nThe Microbiology major, offered by the Department of Bacteriology, is a\nrigorous path of study, providing a curriculum packed with deep knowledge\non broad aspects of microbiology and emphasizing modern laboratory\nskills. The core courses focus on the diversity, genetics, biochemistry,\nand physiology of microorganisms. A variety of elective courses provide\nthe opportunity to study environmental microbiology, food microbiology,\nmicrobial pathogenesis, immunology, virology, microbiomes, and microbial\nbiotechnology, as well as advanced topics in microbial genetics and\nphysiology. In the instructional laboratory courses, students learn\nbeginning through advanced laboratory techniques \u2014 gaining the type\nof hands-on experiences with modern equipment that employers and\ngraduate schools seek. Additionally, students can conduct mentored and\nindependent research projects in faculty laboratories.\nThe bachelor's degree provides a strong background in the biological\nsciences for students planning to enter medical, dental, veterinary, or\nother professional schools, as well as those planning graduate studies\nin any branch of microbiology or other biological sciences such as\nbiochemistry, pathology, and molecular or cell biology.\nStudents who end their training with a bachelor's degree are well-prepared\nfor a variety of career opportunities, including laboratory positions in\npharmaceutical firms, biotechnology firms, university laboratories, and\ngovernment laboratories. They also work as specialists in industrial quality\ntesting and control and as regulatory workers in government agencies and\npublic health laboratories.

For other questions, please contact CALS Academic\nAffairs (academicaffairs@cals.wisc.edu).\nMicrobiology, the study of microorganisms, helps us understand our world\nand solve major problems. Microorganisms, or microbes, were the first life\nforms on Earth and influence our lives and our planet in innumerable ways.\nThe field of microbiology is constantly expanding as we learn more about\nthe role of microbes in infectious disease, environmental remediation,\nbioenergy, food safety, antibiotic resistance, biotechnology, and much\nmore. Communities of microbes (or \"microbiomes\") are critically important\nin human health, global warming, agricultural yield, criminal justice,\neconomic development, and other issues of national concern.\nThe Microbiology major, offered by the Department of Bacteriology, is a\nrigorous path of study, providing a curriculum packed with deep knowledge\non broad aspects of microbiology and emphasizing modern laboratory\nskills. The core courses focus on the diversity, genetics, biochemistry,\nand physiology of microorganisms. A variety of elective courses provide\nthe opportunity to study environmental microbiology, food microbiology,\nmicrobial pathogenesis, immunology, virology, microbiomes, and microbial\nbiotechnology, as well as advanced topics in microbial genetics and\nphysiology. In the instructional laboratory courses, students learn\nbeginning through advanced laboratory techniques \u2014 gaining the type\nof hands-on experiences with modern equipment that employers and\ngraduate schools seek. Additionally, students can conduct mentored and\nindependent research projects in faculty laboratories.\nThe bachelor's degree provides a strong background in the biological\nsciences for students planning to enter medical, dental, veterinary, or\nother professional schools, as well as those planning graduate studies\nin any branch of microbiology or other biological sciences such as\nbiochemistry, pathology, and molecular or cell biology.\nStudents who end their training with a bachelor's degree are well-prepared\nfor a variety of career opportunities, including laboratory positions in\npharmaceutical firms, biotechnology firms, university laboratories, and\ngovernment laboratories. They also work as specialists in industrial quality\ntesting and control and as regulatory workers in government agencies and\npublic health laboratories.

Mathematics bridges the humanities\nand the sciences. Its position among the humanities is based on the study\nof mathematics as one of the liberal arts for more than two thousand\nyears. The natural sciences have invariably turned to mathematics for\ntechniques needed to explore the consequences of scientific theories.\nIn the last few decades, social scientists have increasingly found higher\nmathematics of value in their training and research. Still an expanding\nsubject, mathematics is a part of more new and challenging frontiers than\nat any time in its long history, with many new fields, from data science\nto quantum computing, requiring new techniques and inspiring ideas for\nexploration.\nStudents interested in Mathematics may also wish to consider the\nBachelor of Science\u2014Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics\n(p.\u00a01098) (BS AMEP).\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nDECLARATION\nTo declare a major in mathematics, a student must have completed\nthe sequence MATH\u00a0221, MATH\u00a0222, and MATH\u00a0234, or the\nsequence\u00a0MATH\u00a0375\u00a0and MATH\u00a0376, with a 2.500 GPA or better.\nMajor advisors may waive this requirement for students with alternative\ncoursework and experiences (e.g., transfer students). Students\u00a0should\nmeet with a math advisor before declaring in order to discuss course\nselection and major plan. Advising information can be found in the\nAdvising and Careers (https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-\nscience/mathematics/mathematics-bs/#advisingandcareerstext) link.\nStudents who are declared in the Bachelor of Science-Applied\nMathematics, Engineering, and Physics degree may not be declared in the\nMathematics for Physical and Biological Sciences named option.\nStudents declared in the Mathematics certificate may not be declared\nin the Mathematics major at the same time.

Mathematics bridges the humanities\nand the sciences. Its position among the humanities is based on the study\nof mathematics as one of the liberal arts for more than two thousand\nyears. The natural sciences have invariably turned to mathematics for\ntechniques needed to explore the consequences of scientific theories.\nIn the last few decades, social scientists have increasingly found higher\nmathematics of value in their training and research. Still an expanding\nsubject, mathematics is a part of more new and challenging frontiers than\nat any time in its long history, with many new fields, from data science\nto quantum computing, requiring new techniques and inspiring ideas for\nexploration.\nStudents interested in Mathematics may also wish to consider the\nBachelor of Science\u2014Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics\n(p.\u00a01098) (BS AMEP).\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nDECLARATION\nTo declare a major in mathematics, a student must have completed\nthe sequence MATH\u00a0221, MATH\u00a0222, and MATH\u00a0234, or the\nsequence\u00a0MATH\u00a0375\u00a0and MATH\u00a0376, with a 2.500 GPA or better.\nMajor advisors may waive this requirement for students with alternative\ncoursework and experiences (e.g., transfer students).

The degree is\nalso a good comprehensive performance and music teaching degree that\ncan be excellent preparation for teaching outside of the classroom, for\ngraduate school, or for a career teaching at the college level.\nThis program offers two options: a specialty in Instrumental Music and\na specialty in Choral Music. Regardless of chosen specialty, the BM\ndegree requirements prepare students to teach in all areas of Music (K\u2013\n12) instruction, including General Music. Upon completion of both the\nBachelor of Music: Education and additional statutory and certification\nrequirements, students may choose to apply for a Wisconsin teaching\nlicense in Music (K-12). Music Education is a program offered jointly\nby the School of Music and the School of Education. The Bachelor of\nMusic: Education degree is conferred by the College of Letters & Science;\nteacher certification is earned through the School of Education.\nThe Bachelor of Music: Education curricula accomplish several important\ngoals:\n\u2022 Enable broad teaching certification for music instruction in Wisconsin\u2019s\nelementary and secondary schools, grades K through 12. Students\nmay specialize in vocal or instrumental music, but all students\nsuccessfully completing the program and additional certification\nrequirements will qualify for certification in Music (K-12) in accordance\nwith Wisconsin\u2019s PI 34 requirements as outlined by the Department of\nPublic Instruction.\n\u2022 Explore popular culture in music education.

The center\noffers a broad selection of courses at all levels, which are cross-listed with\nother departments, including Classical and Near Eastern Studies, English,\nGender and Women's Studies, German/Nordic/Slavic Studies, History,\nMusic, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology.\nThe Jewish Studies major offers students an in-depth study of 3,500\nyears of Jewish civilization. The program is interdisciplinary in nature\nand aims to provide students with a broadly based, rigorous liberal arts\neducation in the field. While learning about Jewish history, religion,\nlanguage, and culture, students also develop skills in critical thinking,\nreading, writing, and research \u2014 skills that are valuable to a range of career\npaths.\nDEGREES/MAJORS/CERTIFICATES\nDEGREES/MAJORS/\nCERTIFICATES\n\u2022 Jewish Studies, BA (p.\u00a01200)\n\u2022 Jewish Studies, BS (p.\u00a01204)\n\u2022 Jewish Studies, Certificate (p.\u00a01208)\nJEWISH STUDIES, BA\nFrom history to political science, sociology to music and the arts, Jewish\nStudies is a vibrant, interdisciplinary program that allows you to explore\nJewish civilization from a variety of perspectives.

And while learning how Jews have lived, survived, and\nsometimes flourished, you will gain a deeper comprehension of their rich,\nvaried culture and the world they inhabit.\nSince Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary field, many students\nsimultaneously pursue additional majors or certificates including Art\n(p.\u00a01544), Education (https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/education/\neducational-policy-studies/education-studies-bs/), Geography\n(p.\u00a0757), History (p.\u00a0822), Music (p.\u00a01149), Political Science\n(p.\u00a01251), Religious Studies (p.\u00a01274), and Sociology (p.\u00a01326).\u00a0Given\nthe broad history and geography of the Jewish experience, Jewish Studies\nalso pairs well with programs like African Studies (p.\u00a0861); Classical and\nAncient Near Eastern Studies (p.\u00a0593); European Studies (p.\u00a0867);\nGerman, Nordic, and Slavic (p.\u00a0779); and Middle East Studies (p.\u00a0966).\nTo sample the variety of Jewish Studies offerings, check out our current\ncourses (https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/jewish/).\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nRequirements\nDetails\nHow to get in\nNo application required.

This means that having a major in Philosophy provides excellent\npreparation for a variety of careers.\nStudying philosophy can also help you get into graduate school.\nPhilosophy students excel on standardized tests like the GRE, GMAT, and\nLSAT. They rank first among all majors on the verbal and the analytical\nsections of the GRE. Philosophy students also tend to do better than just\nabout any other major on the LSAT. With a mean score of just over 157,\nthey are second only to Physics students. When it comes to the GMAT,\nPhilosophy students rank in the top five of all majors, and they consistently\nhave higher scores than Business students (including Management,\nFinance, Accounting, and Marketing).\nSUCCESSWORKS\nSuccessWorks (https://successworks.wisc.edu/) at the College of Letters\n& Science helps you turn the academic skills learned in your classes\ninto a fulfilling life, guiding you every step of the way to securing jobs,\ninternships, or admission to graduate school.\nThrough one-on-one career advising, events, and resources, you can\nexplore career options, build valuable internship and research experience,\nand connect with supportive alumni and employers who open doors of\nopportunity.\n\u2022 What you can do with your major (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nwhat-you-can-do-with-your-major/)\u00a0 (Major Skills & Outcomes\nSheets)\n\u2022 Make a career advising appointment (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nmake-an-appointment/)\n\u2022 Learn about internships and internship funding (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/finding-a-job-or-internship/)\n\u2022 Try \u201cJobs, Internships, & How to Get Them,\u201d (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/canvas/) an interactive guide in Canvas for\nenrolled UW\u2013Madison students", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

This\u00a0prize recognizes an outstanding\nessay in value theory, where this is construed quite broadly to include\ntopics in political philosophy, philosophy of law, metaethics, applied ethics,\netc.\u00a0Essays are typically submitted in early April and the winner is also\nhonored at our\u00a0Awards Banquet.\nIf you have any questions about these scholarships or essay prizes, you\nmay send an email to frontoffice@philosophy.wisc.edu.\nPHYSICS\nDEGREES/MAJORS/CERTIFICATES\nDEGREES/MAJORS/\nCERTIFICATES\n\u2022 Physics, BA (p.\u00a01219)\n\u2022 Physics, BS (p.\u00a01226)\n\u2022 Physics, Certificate (p.\u00a01232)\nPHYSICS, BA\nPhysics is the most fundamental of the sciences, interested in the\nproperties of matter, radiation, and energy in all forms. It provides the\nunderlying framework for other physical sciences and engineering and\nfor understanding physical processes in biological and environmental\nsciences. The major gives you:\n\u2022 Intellectual satisfaction: physics satisfies our deep desire to\nunderstand how the universe works. Physics is interesting.\n\u2022 Intellectual challenge: by striving for fundamental understanding, the\nphysicist accepts the challenge to move past a merely descriptive\napproach of our world and probes deeply into how and why it works.\n\u2022 Physics produces new technology: today\u2019s physics research will\nbecome tomorrow's technological advances.\n\u2022 Technical expertise: physicists exploit forefront technologies in their\npursuits.\n\u2022 Flexibility: in a fast-paced and changing world, it is much more\nimportant to have a broad substantive education than to be trained\nin a specific skill. We teach people how to think, and how to apply and\nextend what they know to new types of problems.\n\u2022 Physics is analytical and quantitative: people who can reason\nanalytically and quantitatively are essential for the success of almost\nany pursuit.\nThe Physics major will provide an overall view of both classical and modern\nphysics with the flexibility to continue learning in fields that interest\nyou. It will also help you develop skills in analysis, problem-solving, and\nquantitative reasoning that will aid you in whatever careers you choose.\nWHAT YOU LEARN IN THIS MAJOR WILL:\n\u2022 prepare you for graduate studies for master's or doctoral degrees in\nexperimental or theoretical physics;.\n\u2022 prepare you for employment in industrial or governmental laboratories;\n\u2022 provide a broad background for further work in other sciences, such\nas materials sciences, aerospace, astronomy, computer science,\ngeophysics, meteorology, radiology, medicine, biophysics, engineering,\nand environmental studies;\n\u2022 provide a science-oriented education. This training can be useful in\nsome areas of business administration, law, or other fields where a\nbasic knowledge of science is useful.\n\u2022 provide part of the preparation you need to teach physics. To teach\nphysics in high school, you will also take education courses to become\ncertified.

Physics is interesting.\n\u2022 Intellectual challenge: by striving for fundamental understanding, the\nphysicist accepts the challenge to move past a merely descriptive\napproach of our world and probes deeply into how and why it works.\n\u2022 Physics produces new technology: today\u2019s physics research will\nbecome tomorrow's technological advances.\n\u2022 Technical expertise: physicists exploit forefront technologies in their\npursuits.\n\u2022 Flexibility: in a fast-paced and changing world, it is much more\nimportant to have a broad substantive education than to be trained\nin a specific skill. We teach people how to think, and how to apply and\nextend what they know to new types of problems.\n\u2022 Physics is analytical and quantitative: people who can reason\nanalytically and quantitatively are essential for the success of almost\nany pursuit.\nThe Physics major will provide an overall view of both classical and modern\nphysics with the flexibility to continue learning in fields that interest\nyou. It will also help you develop skills in analysis, problem-solving, and\nquantitative reasoning that will aid you in whatever careers you choose.\nWHAT YOU LEARN IN THIS MAJOR WILL:\n\u2022 prepare you for graduate studies for master's or doctoral degrees in\nexperimental or theoretical physics;.\n\u2022 prepare you for employment in industrial or governmental laboratories;\n\u2022 provide a broad background for further work in other sciences, such\nas materials sciences, aerospace, astronomy, computer science,\ngeophysics, meteorology, radiology, medicine, biophysics, engineering,\nand environmental studies;\n\u2022 provide a science-oriented education. This training can be useful in\nsome areas of business administration, law, or other fields where a\nbasic knowledge of science is useful.\n\u2022 provide part of the preparation you need to teach physics. To teach\nphysics in high school, you will also take education courses to become\ncertified. You will need a doctoral degree to become a college or\nuniversity professor.\nInterested in the undergraduate physics program?

Landscape\narchitects design public and private outdoor spaces, restore and help\npreserve natural areas, develop and implement regional planning and\npublic policy, and revitalize urban neighborhoods. The professional\nBachelor of Landscape Architecture degree program focuses on form-\ngiving design, design implementation, and professional practice. Emphasis\nis placed on principles of design theory and process; problem solving in\nrelationship to human needs and aspirations, environmental awareness\nand stewardship; and on the development of technical proficiencies\nrequired of professional practice. Students learn site analysis, graphic\ncommunication, design synthesis, construction technology, and the social\nand environmental factors that are part of design.\nThe Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree program provides\nprofessional education accredited by the American Society of Landscape\nArchitects (ASLA) (https://www.asla.org/AccreditationLAAB.aspx).\nStudents completing the requirements for this program are granted a BLA\ndegree.

It\ndrew on a tradition of inquiry that brought the three perspectives together.\nSince its creation at Oxford, similar programs have been created at many\nof the world\u2019s leading universities.\nIf we move from the insight behind the program to what it means in\npractice, we can see that understanding, for example, immigration requires\nunderstanding it from political, economic, and ethical perspectives. In\nshort, understanding the pressing political, economic, or philosophical\nproblems of the day entails seeing them from a perspective that\nbrings together all three disciplines. As a result, the Political Economy,\nPhilosophy, and Politics certificate curriculum brings together faculty\nand coursework from three different academic departments: Economics,\nPhilosophy, and Political Science.

But whether a definition\nfocuses on the analysis of governmental structures, or influences on\nvoter choice, or the relationship between national governments, or the\nbest form of government, political science is about the systematic study\nof power. Whether power is exercised formally, as is the case between\ngovernment and the individual, or informally, as is the case between\nindividuals, it is the systematic study of power relationships that provides\nthe subject matter for the discipline. Students studying political science\nobtain not only an understanding of the workings of government, but they\nalso develop important skills in critical thinking and analysis. These skills\nmake them ideal candidates for careers in law; in government at the state,\nnational, and international levels; in business; in journalism; and in politics.\nWHAT CAREERS DO POLITICAL SCIENCE\nMAJORS PURSUE?\nPolitical Science students learn quickly, work well in teams, and have basic\nunderstanding of the policy process and the operations of government.\nPolitical Science students understand that for every endeavor, no matter\nhow important, there is a mountain of ordinary grunt work that has to\nbe done. Political Science students can be counted on to do the foot-\nwork, put in the face-time, and endure the slog necessary of everything of\nconsequence.\nPolitical Science students go on to work in all levels of government.\nLocal and state governments have a direct impact on the quality of life\nof all Americans. Courses on state and urban government, public policy,\nadministrative law, and public administration are especially valuable.\nQuantitative and statistical skills developed in these courses and applied in\nthe internships many of our students do provide a powerful combination.\nPolitical Science students go on to work in a wide range of International\ncareers, in business, Foreign Service, and nongovernmental organizations.\nPolitical Science offers a wide variety of courses in comparative\npolitics, international relations and organizations, public policy, political\ndevelopment, and interest group politics. These courses in combination\nwith economics, statistics, computer science, and international trade.\nPolitical Science students pursue careers in campaign management,\npolitical polling, national political committees, and consulting. They will\nhave taken multiple courses in the American political system, comparative\npolitical parties, elections, public opinion, and voting behavior; as well\nas committing themselves to developing their writing and data analysis.\nThere are over half a million campaigns in the United States annually, and\nwhile entry-level jobs have long hours, low pay, and enormous demands,", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

But whether a definition\nfocuses on the analysis of governmental structures, or influences on\nvoter choice, or the relationship between national governments, or the\nbest form of government, political science is about the systematic study\nof power. Whether power is exercised formally, as is the case between\ngovernment and the individual, or informally, as is the case between\nindividuals, it is the systematic study of power relationships that provides\nthe subject matter for the discipline. Students studying political science\nobtain not only an understanding of the workings of government, but they\nalso develop important skills in critical thinking and analysis. These skills\nmake them ideal candidates for careers in law; in government at the state,\nnational, and international levels; in business; in journalism; and in politics.\nWHAT CAREERS DO POLITICAL SCIENCE\nMAJORS PURSUE?\nPolitical Science students learn quickly, work well in teams, and have basic\nunderstanding of the policy process and the operations of government.\nPolitical Science students understand that for every endeavor, no matter\nhow important, there is a mountain of ordinary grunt work that has to\nbe done. Political Science students can be counted on to do the foot-\nwork, put in the face-time, and endure the slog necessary of everything of\nconsequence.\nPolitical Science students go on to work in all levels of government.\nLocal and state governments have a direct impact on the quality of life\nof all Americans. Courses on state and urban government, public policy,\nadministrative law, and public administration are especially valuable.\nQuantitative and statistical skills developed in these courses and applied in\nthe internships many of our students do provide a powerful combination.\nPolitical Science students go on to work in a wide range of International\ncareers, in business, Foreign Service, and nongovernmental organizations.\nPolitical Science offers a wide variety of courses in comparative", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

But whether a definition\nfocuses on the analysis of governmental structures, or influences on\nvoter choice, or the relationship between national governments, or the\nbest form of government, political science is about the systematic study\nof power.

To this end, students of religion\nlearn to use a variety of theoretical analyses and methods:\n\u2022 historical methods to understand how religions develop in time;\n\u2022 critical literary methods to understand religious ideas;\n\u2022 aesthetic methods to understand religious art and material culture;\n\u2022 social-scientific methods to understand the relationship between\nreligion, society and culture.\nReligious studies can also engage a variety of professional disciplines in\nanalysis of how religion functions in economic, educational or political\ncontexts, healthcare and scientific research, and others.\nSome ways of studying religion emphasize understanding religions on their\nown terms, other ways use comparative methods to discern differences\nand similarities between religions. Students of religion also study ways that\npeople use religious resources to make meaning outside the boundaries of\nreligious institutions and identities. Above all, the field of religious studies\nrequires a willingness to explore different ways of interpreting human\nlife and diligent effort to develop understanding of how religious ideas,\nsymbols, rituals and spaces serve as resources for people in a variety of\ncontexts as they make sense of and live out their lives in the world.

Students\nwhose academic performance drops below these minimum\nthresholds will be placed on academic probation.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n1. (Conduct Research and Analyze Data) Sociology encompasses both\nqualitative and quantitative research methods. Quantitative methods\nare used in market research, opinion polling, sales, government, and\ncountless other applications and allow researchers to recognize trends\nand patterns and produce social statistics. Qualitative research skills\nprovide an in depth understanding of interactions, communications,\nworksite practices, and social worlds. Advanced sociological research\nmethods require graduate#level training beyond the scope of our\nundergraduate major, but we expect that all undergraduate majors\nwill be able to conduct small-scale research using surveys, interviews,\nexperiments, textual analysis or observations in which they formulate a\nresearch question, collect data, analyze results, and draw conclusions.\n2. (Critically Evaluate Published Research) Sociology graduates will be\nable to read and evaluate published research as it appears in academic\njournals and popular or policy publications. They will be able to identify\nthe research methods used, assess the quality of the sample, assess\nthe quality of measurements and procedures, evaluate the links\nbetween the data and the interpretations, identify possible threats to\nthe validity of the results, and provide an overall assessment of the\ntrustworthiness of the research results. They will be able to read and\nevaluate a set of research articles on the same broad issue and be able\nto draw summarize the research findings across multiple issue.\n3. (Communicate Skillfully) Because the sociology major involves a\nlarge amount of reading, writing, and discussion, majors learn how\nto convey ideas effectively in writing, presentations, and everyday\nconferences and meetings. Sociology majors write papers and make\noral presentations that build arguments and assess evidence in a clear\nand effective manner.\n4. (Critical Thinking about Society and Social Processes) Sociological\ninquiry involves learning to look beyond the surface of issues to\ndiscover the \"why\" and \"how\" of social order and structure. Sociology\nmajors develop strong analytical skills and learn to solve problems and\nidentify opportunities. They are able to consider the underlying social", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

(See Things from a Global Perspective) Sociologists learn about\ndifferent cultures, groups, and societies. They examine both variation\nand universality across places and through history. They are aware of\nthe diversity of backgrounds and experiences among residents of the\nUnited States. They understand the ways events and processes in one\ncountry are linked to those in other countries.\n6. (Prepare for Graduate School and the Job Market) An undergraduate\nmajor in sociology provides an excellent foundation for work and\ngraduate study in a wide range of fields including law, business, social\nwork, medicine, policy research, public health, public administration\nand, of course, sociology. With the aid of faculty and staff, students\nuse their social research skills to identify opportunities for employment\nor further study , assess their qualifications for these opportunities,\nand identify strategies for gaining the necessary knowledge and\nexperience to improve their qualifications. Students are encouraged to\ndevelop and maintain portfolios of their written work and educational\nexperiences to aid them in preparing applications.\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nThis Four-Year Plan is only one way a student may complete an L&S\ndegree with this major. Many factors can affect student degree planning,\nincluding placement scores, credit for transferred courses, credits earned\nby examination, and individual scholarly interests. In addition, many\nstudents have commitments (e.g., athletics, honors, research, student\norganizations, study abroad, work and volunteer experiences) that\nnecessitate they adjust their plans accordingly.

Even the most well-prepared new\nstudents will have moments when they say to themselves, \u201cUh oh. What\nhave I got myself into going to such a big school? Choosing courses at\nSOAR was stressful, fun, or both, but after SOAR am I on my own?\u201d The\nanswer is no. Every student has at least one assigned advisor. Over the\ncourse of their time at the university, students may have several assigned\nadvisors. That is a good thing; L&S advisors are highly networked, and they\nalways communicate with each other about shared students.\nWhen students read their DARS reports\u2014documents that were developed\nto help them find their way to a timely graduation\u2014they can feel\noverwhelmed; it looks like they need 500 credits to graduate. How can\nthey get all those requirements done? Do Sociology (or Spanish, or\nEnglish) majors really have to take biology courses?\nIn the Sociology Department, we take advising very seriously. We\nencourage our majors to see the advisor at least once every semester.\nThe advisor will help you summarize the DARS and map your completed\ncoursework onto the goals and timeline for graduation, including the\nSociology major and L&S requirements. The Sociology advisor will have\ndepartmental or college news about guest speakers, new faculty, new\ncourses, internships, and scholarships.

Students\nwhose academic performance drops below these minimum\nthresholds will be placed on academic probation.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n1. (Conduct Research and Analyze Data) Sociology encompasses both\nqualitative and quantitative research methods. Quantitative methods\nare used in market research, opinion polling, sales, government, and\ncountless other applications and allow researchers to recognize trends\nand patterns and produce social statistics. Qualitative research skills\nprovide an in depth understanding of interactions, communications,\nworksite practices, and social worlds. Advanced sociological research\nmethods require graduate#level training beyond the scope of our\nundergraduate major, but we expect that all undergraduate majors\nwill be able to conduct small-scale research using surveys, interviews,\nexperiments, textual analysis or observations in which they formulate a\nresearch question, collect data, analyze results, and draw conclusions.\n2. (Critically Evaluate Published Research) Sociology graduates will be\nable to read and evaluate published research as it appears in academic\njournals and popular or policy publications. They will be able to identify\nthe research methods used, assess the quality of the sample, assess\nthe quality of measurements and procedures, evaluate the links\nbetween the data and the interpretations, identify possible threats to\nthe validity of the results, and provide an overall assessment of the\ntrustworthiness of the research results. They will be able to read and\nevaluate a set of research articles on the same broad issue and be able\nto draw summarize the research findings across multiple issue.\n3. (Communicate Skillfully) Because the sociology major involves a\nlarge amount of reading, writing, and discussion, majors learn how\nto convey ideas effectively in writing, presentations, and everyday\nconferences and meetings. Sociology majors write papers and make\noral presentations that build arguments and assess evidence in a clear\nand effective manner.\n4. (Critical Thinking about Society and Social Processes) Sociological\ninquiry involves learning to look beyond the surface of issues to\ndiscover the \"why\" and \"how\" of social order and structure. Sociology\nmajors develop strong analytical skills and learn to solve problems and\nidentify opportunities. They are able to consider the underlying social", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

(See Things from a Global Perspective) Sociologists learn about\ndifferent cultures, groups, and societies. They examine both variation\nand universality across places and through history. They are aware of\nthe diversity of backgrounds and experiences among residents of the\nUnited States. They understand the ways events and processes in one\ncountry are linked to those in other countries.\n6. (Prepare for Graduate School and the Job Market) An undergraduate\nmajor in sociology provides an excellent foundation for work and\ngraduate study in a wide range of fields including law, business, social\nwork, medicine, policy research, public health, public administration\nand, of course, sociology. With the aid of faculty and staff, students\nuse their social research skills to identify opportunities for employment\nor further study , assess their qualifications for these opportunities,\nand identify strategies for gaining the necessary knowledge and\nexperience to improve their qualifications. Students are encouraged to\ndevelop and maintain portfolios of their written work and educational\nexperiences to aid them in preparing applications.\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nThis Four-Year Plan is only one way a student may complete an L&S\ndegree with this major. Many factors can affect student degree planning,\nincluding placement scores, credit for transferred courses, credits earned\nby examination, and individual scholarly interests. In addition, many\nstudents have commitments (e.g., athletics, honors, research, student\norganizations, study abroad, work and volunteer experiences) that\nnecessitate they adjust their plans accordingly.

Even the most well-prepared new\nstudents will have moments when they say to themselves, \u201cUh oh. What\nhave I got myself into going to such a big school? Choosing courses at\nSOAR was stressful, fun, or both, but after SOAR am I on my own?\u201d The\nanswer is no. Every student has at least one assigned advisor. Over the\ncourse of their time at the university, students may have several assigned\nadvisors. That is a good thing; L&S advisors are highly networked, and they\nalways communicate with each other about shared students.\nWhen students read their DARS reports\u2014documents that were developed\nto help them find their way to a timely graduation\u2014they can feel\noverwhelmed; it looks like they need 500 credits to graduate. How can\nthey get all those requirements done? Do Sociology (or Spanish, or\nEnglish) majors really have to take biology courses?\nIn the Sociology Department, we take advising very seriously. We\nencourage our majors to see the advisor at least once every semester.\nThe advisor will help you summarize the DARS and map your completed\ncoursework onto the goals and timeline for graduation, including the\nSociology major and L&S requirements. The Sociology advisor will have\ndepartmental or college news about guest speakers, new faculty, new\ncourses, internships, and scholarships. This advisor will also be able to\nassist in preparation for, and applications to graduate school, and be\nable to connect students with faculty whose information about various\nSociology programs is always the most current.

It has been developed to deal rationally and objectively\nwith the uncertainty that accompanies variation in phenomena as highly\ncomplex as the interplay of the many factors that affect our environment.\nIt derives vitality in coping with practical problems arising in all fields of\nscientific activity, including the social, business, biological, agricultural,\nmedical, natural, and engineering sciences. Investigators\u2019 efforts to\nlearn about a specific phenomenon, be it the response of a patient to a\ncertain medical treatment or the effectiveness of a particular instructional\nprogram on a student\u2019s learning, are impacted by the presence of natural\nvariation. The field of statistics is concerned with valid and efficient ways\nto learn more about these phenomena in the presence of such variation.\nIt is an inductive science in which information is extracted from sample\ndata in order to draw inferences. This process most often involves planning\nexperiments or designing studies to ensure that valid answers to questions\nare obtained from the sample.\nDEGREES/MAJORS/CERTIFICATES\nDEGREES/MAJORS/\nCERTIFICATES\n\u2022 Data Science, BA (p.\u00a01354)\n\u2022 Data Science, BS (p.\u00a01359)\n\u2022 Data Science, Certificate (p.\u00a01364)\n\u2022 Statistics, BA (p.\u00a01366)\n\u2022 Statistics, BS (p.\u00a01371)\n\u2022 Statistics, Certificate (p.\u00a01375)\nDATA SCIENCE, BA\nStudents in the Data Science major will be able to apply computational,\nmathematical, and statistical thinking to data-rich problems in a wide\nvariety of fields in a responsible and ethical manner.

These skills can be employed in a wide\nvariety of different sectors of employment. Examples of interests of our\nstudents include finance, banking, sports analytics, marketing, retail,\nhumanities, psychology, biosciences, healthcare, and consulting, just to\nname a few. Students are encouraged to combine Data Science with\nmajors, certificates, and courses from differing areas to best be able to\napply their data science in the area of their choosing.\nData science is one of the fastest-growing areas of jobs in the United\nStates and in Wisconsin. The Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH)\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/\ndata-scientists.htm) shows the job growth outlook from 2023-33 for Data\nScientists to be 36% (much faster than average).\nSome students may want to continue to develop additional advanced data\nscience skills through graduate education.\nDEPARTMENTAL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Data Science Skills Sheet (https://drive.google.com/file/\nd/1Srak_e7Arr4XA9WBZ0xiOTPZnIUxPfsE/view/), aka What you\ncan do with your Data Science major\n\u2022 Career Pathways for Statistics and Data Science Canvas Course\u00a0\n(https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/3JWLRW/)\n\u2022 Department of Statistics Student Career Resources webpage\n(https://stat.wisc.edu/student-career-resources/)\nSUCCESSWORKS\nSuccessWorks (https://successworks.wisc.edu/) at the College of Letters\n& Science helps you turn the academic skills learned in your classes\ninto a fulfilling life, guiding you every step of the way to securing jobs,\ninternships, or admission to graduate school.\nThrough one-on-one career advising, events, and resources, you can\nexplore career options, build valuable internship and research experience,\nand connect with supportive alumni and employers who open doors of\nopportunity.\n\u2022 What you can do with your major (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nwhat-you-can-do-with-your-major/)\u00a0 (Major Skills & Outcomes\nSheets)\n\u2022 Make a career advising appointment (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nmake-an-appointment/)\n\u2022 Learn about internships and internship funding (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/finding-a-job-or-internship/)\n\u2022 Try \u201cJobs, Internships, & How to Get Them,\u201d (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/canvas/) an interactive guide in Canvas for\nenrolled UW\u2013Madison students\nRESOURCES AND SCHOLARSHIPS\nRESOURCES AND\nSCHOLARSHIPS\nHelpful resources can be found at scholarships (https://\nfinancialaid.wisc.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships/) and the\u00a0Wisconsin\nScholarship Hub (https://wisc.academicworks.com/).

Students are encouraged to combine Data Science with\nmajors, certificates, and courses from differing areas to best be able to\napply their data science in the area of their choosing.\nData science is one of the fastest-growing areas of jobs in the United\nStates and in Wisconsin. The Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH)\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/\ndata-scientists.htm) shows the job growth outlook from 2023-33 for Data\nScientists to be 36% (much faster than average).\nSome students may want to continue to develop additional advanced data\nscience skills through graduate education.\nSUCCESSWORKS\nSuccessWorks (https://successworks.wisc.edu/) at the College of Letters\n& Science helps you turn the academic skills learned in your classes\ninto a fulfilling life, guiding you every step of the way to securing jobs,\ninternships, or admission to graduate school.\nThrough one-on-one career advising, events, and resources, you can\nexplore career options, build valuable internship and research experience,\nand connect with supportive alumni and employers who open doors of\nopportunity.\n\u2022 What you can do with your major (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nwhat-you-can-do-with-your-major/)\u00a0 (Major Skills & Outcomes\nSheets)\n\u2022 Make a career advising appointment (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nmake-an-appointment/)\n\u2022 Learn about internships and internship funding (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/finding-a-job-or-internship/)\n\u2022 Try \u201cJobs, Internships, & How to Get Them,\u201d (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/canvas/) an interactive guide in Canvas for\nenrolled UW\u2013Madison students\nSTATISTICS, BA\nModern statistics is an exciting subject that affects most aspects of\nmodern living. It has been developed to deal rationally and objectively\nwith the uncertainty that accompanies variation in phenomena as highly\ncomplex as the interplay of the many factors that affect our environment.\nIt derives vitality in coping with practical problems arising in all fields of\nscientific activity, including the social, business, biological, agricultural,\nmedical, natural, and engineering sciences. Investigators\u2019 efforts to\nlearn about a specific phenomenon, be it the response of a patient to a\ncertain medical treatment or the effectiveness of a particular instructional\nprogram on a student\u2019s learning, are impacted by the presence of natural\nvariation. The field of statistics is concerned with valid and efficient ways\nto learn more about these phenomena in the presence of such variation.\nIt is an inductive science in which information is extracted from sample\ndata in order to draw inferences. This process most often involves planning\nexperiments or designing studies to ensure that valid answers to questions\nare obtained from the sample.\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nTo declare the statistics major, students should schedule an appointment\nwith a statistics major advisor prior to attaining senior standing (86\ncredits).\u00a0\u00a0 Information regarding major declaration and how to schedule\nan appointment is available on the major webpage (https://stat.wisc.edu/\nundergraduate-statistics-major/).\nStudents must have a 2.000 GPA on coursework counting in the major,\nand a 2.000 GPA on any upper-level work in the major completed prior to\ndeclaration.\u00a0 No specific coursework must be completed to declare.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

Statisticians work in industry and business, in\ngovernment, and in universities and other research institutions.\nIn most cases, a student who completed the Statistics major can find\nemployment as a quantitative analyst or other \u201cgeneralist\u201d position.\nA number of our graduates have been successful following this path.\nHowever, in most cases, positions aimed at professional statisticians\nrequire a master\u2018s degree or PhD. As a professional statistician, typical\nemployment in industry might be as a statistical consultant to biologists,\nengineers, or other scientists in a research-and-development branch of a\nlarge company.\nThe best place to look for statistics jobs is the\u00a0American Statistical\nAssociation Career Center (http://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/\nhome.aspx). Consult with a Statistics undergraduate advisor about the\nbest fit for you.\nStatistical training is seen as very desirable in many other areas (e.g.,\nagricultural, biological, engineering, and social sciences, business, and\neconomics) where the primary activity may not be statistics. In view of this,\nstatistics may often be a strong choice for a second or additional major.\nSUCCESSWORKS\nSuccessWorks (https://successworks.wisc.edu/) at the College of Letters\n& Science helps you turn the academic skills learned in your classes\ninto a fulfilling life, guiding you every step of the way to securing jobs,\ninternships, or admission to graduate school.\nThrough one-on-one career advising, events, and resources, you can\nexplore career options, build valuable internship and research experience,\nand connect with supportive alumni and employers who open doors of\nopportunity.\n\u2022 What you can do with your major (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nwhat-you-can-do-with-your-major/)\u00a0 (Major Skills & Outcomes\nSheets)\n\u2022 Make a career advising appointment (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nmake-an-appointment/)\n\u2022 Learn about internships and internship funding (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/finding-a-job-or-internship/)\n\u2022 Try \u201cJobs, Internships, & How to Get Them,\u201d (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/canvas/) an interactive guide in Canvas for\nenrolled UW\u2013Madison students\nSTATISTICS, BS\nModern statistics is an exciting subject that affects most aspects of\nmodern living. It has been developed to deal rationally and objectively\nwith the uncertainty that accompanies variation in phenomena as highly\ncomplex as the interplay of the many factors that affect our environment.\nIt derives vitality in coping with practical problems arising in all fields of\nscientific activity, including the social, business, biological, agricultural,\nmedical, natural, and engineering sciences. Investigators\u2019 efforts to\nlearn about a specific phenomenon, be it the response of a patient to a\ncertain medical treatment or the effectiveness of a particular instructional\nprogram on a student\u2019s learning, are impacted by the presence of natural\nvariation. The field of statistics is concerned with valid and efficient ways\nto learn more about these phenomena in the presence of such variation.\nIt is an inductive science in which information is extracted from sample\ndata in order to draw inferences. This process most often involves planning\nexperiments or designing studies to ensure that valid answers to questions\nare obtained from the sample.\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nTo declare the statistics major, students should schedule an appointment\nwith a statistics major advisor prior to attaining senior standing (86\ncredits).\u00a0\u00a0 Information regarding major declaration and how to schedule\nan appointment is available on the major webpage (https://stat.wisc.edu/\nundergraduate-statistics-major/).\nStudents must have a 2.000 GPA on coursework counting in the major,\nand a 2.000 GPA on any upper-level work in the major completed prior to\ndeclaration.\u00a0 No specific coursework must be completed to declare.\nREQUIREMENTS\nUNIVERSITY GENERAL\nEDUCATION REQUIREMENTS\nAll undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are\nrequired to fulfill a minimum set of common\u00a0university general education\nrequirements to ensure that every graduate acquires the essential core\nof an undergraduate education.

Statisticians work in industry and business, in\ngovernment, and in universities and other research institutions.\nIn most cases, a student who completed the Statistics major can find\nemployment as a quantitative analyst or other \u201cgeneralist\u201d position.\nA number of our graduates have been successful following this path.\nHowever, in most cases, positions aimed at professional statisticians\nrequire a master\u2018s degree or PhD. As a professional statistician, typical\nemployment in industry might be as a statistical consultant to biologists,\nengineers, or other scientists in a research-and-development branch of a\nlarge company.\nThe best place to look for statistics jobs is the\u00a0American Statistical\nAssociation Career Center (http://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/\nhome.aspx). Consult with a Statistics undergraduate advisor about the\nbest fit for you.\nStatistical training is seen as very desirable in many other areas (e.g.,\nagricultural, biological, engineering, and social sciences, business, and\neconomics) where the primary activity may not be statistics. In view of this,\nstatistics may often be a strong choice for a second or additional major.\nSUCCESSWORKS\nSuccessWorks (https://successworks.wisc.edu/) at the College of Letters\n& Science helps you turn the academic skills learned in your classes\ninto a fulfilling life, guiding you every step of the way to securing jobs,\ninternships, or admission to graduate school.\nThrough one-on-one career advising, events, and resources, you can\nexplore career options, build valuable internship and research experience,\nand connect with supportive alumni and employers who open doors of\nopportunity.\n\u2022 What you can do with your major (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nwhat-you-can-do-with-your-major/)\u00a0 (Major Skills & Outcomes\nSheets)\n\u2022 Make a career advising appointment (https://successworks.wisc.edu/\nmake-an-appointment/)\n\u2022 Learn about internships and internship funding (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/finding-a-job-or-internship/)\n\u2022 Try \u201cJobs, Internships, & How to Get Them,\u201d (https://\nsuccessworks.wisc.edu/canvas/) an interactive guide in Canvas for\nenrolled UW\u2013Madison students\nSTATISTICS, CERTIFICATE\nThe Statistics certificate is a great fit for students who wish to use\nstatistical principles to solve data problems with a mathematical approach.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

In 2002, it was renamed in honor of former\nWisconsin governor and U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson, the founder of Earth\nDay and a lifelong champion of environmental stewardship.\nThe program espouses an integrated approach to learning about the\nenvironment. Students are encouraged to consider their interests,\nstrengths, and values beyond the context of their courses and connect\nthe subject of the environment to their other courses as well as their\nextracurricular experiences. The Nelson Institute is a robust environmental\ncommunity in which students learn about current environmental issues,\nand more important, how to link environmental science, policy, literature,\nart, and philosophy to other fields of study. The focus on the intentional\nintegration of their academic endeavors with their interests, skills, and\nvalues provides a powerful source of self-awareness that prepares\nstudents for success across a variety of options. Finding one\u2019s strength\nwithin this interdisciplinary approach affords students access to a wide\nvariety of career settings and postgraduate options.\nApproximately 170 faculty members from more than 50 natural and social\nscience, engineering, and humanities departments are affiliated with\nthe Nelson Institute, which offers scores of undergraduate-level courses\nin cooperation with the university's schools and colleges. The institute\noffers an undergraduate major and two certificates. The environmental\nstudies major must always be done in tandem with another major on\ncampus. Environmental studies majors have second majors in every\nschool and college on campus, and the student population reflects the\ninterdisciplinary focus of the Nelson Institute and its curricular offerings.\nAll UW\u2013Madison undergraduates are invited to consider the program.\nDEGREES/MAJORS/CERTIFICATES\nDEGREES/MAJORS/\nCERTIFICATES\n\u2022 Environmental Studies, Certificate (p.\u00a01378)\n\u2022 Sustainability, Certificate (p.\u00a01384)", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}
