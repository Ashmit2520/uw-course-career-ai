This guidance includes courses taken for transfer credit\nat another accredited institution as well as courses taken on a School\nof Business or UW\u2013Madison-sponsored study abroad program. The\nacademic departments of the School of Business strongly recommend\nthat all business students complete the core or initial course in their\nmajor(s) on campus.\nWhile School of Business undergraduate students are able to take courses\noff-campus, the School of Business Undergraduate Program reminds\nstudents that they should plan to complete all prerequisites for any off-\ncampus course, regardless of its place in the BBA curriculum, prior to\ntaking the course off-campus. Attention to these prerequisites is crucial\nto ensuring School of Business undergraduate students are prepared for\ntheir coursework whether it is taken on or off campus. Advance academic\nplanning is an integral part of a student\u2019s success and ability to remain\non track to graduate. Students are strongly encouraged to share with\ntheir advisor if they plan to enroll in coursework off-campus at any time\nonce they are a UW\u2013Madison student. Advisors assist students in making\ndecisions regarding enrollment in off-campus coursework and share\nresources with students to ensure that courses will transfer to UW\u2013\nMadison for degree credit and satisfy the requirement(s) they expect.\nWhile students are always encouraged to share this information with their\nadvisor, students are required to gain permission to take courses off-\ncampus in certain circumstances.\nConcurrent Enrollment\nSchool of Business students are not allowed to enroll concurrently at\nother institutions of higher learning during any term in which they are\nenrolled at UW\u2013Madison (fall, spring) without seeking special permission\nvia the Petition for Special Consideration (https://business.wisc.edu/", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

The UW\u2013Madison Office of the Registrar handles transfer course\nequivalencies. Please note that UW\u2013Madison School of Business students\nmay not take courses at another institution during the fall or spring\nsemester if they are concurrently taking courses at UW\u2013Madison (see\nconcurrent enrollment policy). Students may take no more than one\ncourse off-campus during winter recess. Students interested in earning\ntransfer credit for a non\u2013UW study abroad program must work with\nUW\u2013Madison's International Academic Programs well in advance.\nIt is highly recommended that students do not take a course unless they\nknow in advance that it will transfer to UW\u2013Madison for credit. The Office\nof the Registrar provides information regarding how to determine course\nequivalencies (https://registrar.wisc.edu/transfer-your-credit-to-uw-\nmadison/).\nTransfer Credit Process\n\u2022 Review your DARS report and consult your academic advisor to see\nwhat you still need to take and whether the course(s) would be a\ngood option to take at another institution over the summer or winter\nsession.

The following policies apply to students\npursuing one of the School of Business online degree programs.\nCOURSES/ENROLLMENT\nProgram Requirements\nWhen students enter a School of Business online degree program, they are\nheld to the degree requirements described in the most recent Guide. The\nterm of admittance to the online program results in a catalog and alternate\ncatalog year that reflects the most recent BBA requirements for the online\nprogram.\n10 Semester Rule for Reentry Students\nStudents re-entering after an absence of 10 or more semesters:\nA business student reentering UW\u2013Madison is responsible for completing\nall the current School of Business degree requirements that are in effect at\nthe time of reentry to UW\u2013Madison and the School of Business. Students\nwho left the institution as a business student do not need to reapply for\nadmission to the School of Business when they return.\nModality\nThe modality for School of Business online degree program courses is\nonline only. Students in an online program who are enrolled in a class\nsection that is not \"Online Only\" will be dropped from that class section.\nA change of program that requires a change of modality of instruction is\nnot permitted. Should there be compelling extenuating circumstances that\njustify a change in learning modality option for an individual student, the\nstudent may request of change of modality via the Petition for Special\nConsideration (https://business.wisc.edu/undergraduate/academic-\nadvising/).\nGraduation\nThe School of Business will graduate a student at the end of the semester\n(spring, summer, or fall) in which all university, BBA degree, and business\nmajor requirements are complete with a cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher.\nStudents cannot graduate with a temporary grade (https://\nregistrar.wisc.edu/valid-grades/), such as I or NR, for any requirements.\nSpeak with the course instructor or your advisor to resolve temporary\ngrades.

Please note that students may\ntake no more than one course off-campus during winter recess.\nIf it is discovered that a student violated this policy, this credit will be\nremoved from the student\u2019s record. It is the responsibility of the student\nto verify with their academic advisor that they are not in violation of this\npolicy.\nIndependent Learning\nUW Independent Learning (UW IL) is a branch of UW Extension that\noffers online and distance learning courses. Courses taken through UW\nIndependent Learning are considered concurrent enrollment and require\nspecial permission to enroll in the fall, spring, or summer.\nStudents interested in taking a course through UW IL should meet with an\nacademic advisor.

The school prepares students in a variety of\ndisciplines and for a range of professional roles, including artist, teacher,\nand therapist.\nApproximately 2,200 undergraduates are enrolled each year in the School\nof Education. While many students are pursuing teacher certification, a\nsignificant number are completing programs in the performing and visual\narts, human movement, and human services.\nThe School of Education offers a broad array of undergraduate programs\nthat reflect the wide range of disciplines housed in the school.

Actions can be grouped into\ntwo broad categories:\n\u2022 those that permit exceptions to program requirements and\nschool/university policies and\n\u2022 those that affect a student's standing in the university \u2014\ne.g., probation or transferring from one program to another.\nAs the undergraduate dean's office, the School of Education Student\nServices office is responsible for reviewing, approving, documenting,\nand sometimes initiating academic actions and exceptions. To be\nposted to a student's record, exceptions must go through several\nsteps. Exceptions may be initiated either by program faculty/staff\nor by Student Services staff, who often consult about a specific\nexception. Once an exception has been approved, it is processed\neither as an official \"Dean's action\" or as a DARS exception. Students\ncan find a record of dean's actions on their printed unofficial\ntranscript (also called\u00a0the\u00a0student record) or on their DARS report.\nA DARS exception will be reflected in the individual student's DARS\nreport.\nExceptions to faculty-approved program requirements generally\ninclude course substitutions and rarely involve\u00a0course or program\nrequirement waivers.\u00a0Exceptions to campus or School policies\ninclude permission for adding or dropping a course beyond the\ndeadlines, waiving senior or major residency requirements, extending\nthe deadline for meeting a deficiency or finishing an Incomplete, and\npermitting students to repeat a course for credit.

Retroactive credits and credits granted by\nexamination do not count toward the residency requirement.\nSenior Residency\nSeniors in the School of Education must complete the last 30\ncredits in residence. Special permission to take a portion of senior\nwork either at another institution or by correspondence (via\nUW Extension) must be obtained in advance from the School of\nEducation Student Services office. Coursework taken as part of\na UW\u2013Madison-sponsored study abroad program does not count\nagainst senior residency.

Full-time or part-time\nstudent status is usually determined by the credits taken at UW\u2013\nMadison only; thus, students who take only nine credits on campus\nand three credits at another institution may\u00a0not be considered full-\ntime students.\nCredit Overload Permission\nStudents may carry a maximum of 18 credits per semester\nwithout the special permission of an academic dean.\u00a0School\nof Education undergraduates wishing to take over 18 credits\nshould complete the Credit Overload Request Form (https://\nuwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a5bKn4mlGaeCnpb/).\nStudents must be in excellent academic standing to be considered\nfor a credit overload, usually a 3.0 cumulative GPA on the UW\u2013\nMadison campus.\nPlease note that additional fees are assessed for credit\noverloads on a per-credit basis.\nDuring summer sessions, students may, as a rule, carry one credit per\nweek of instruction unless special permission is given. The maximum\ncredit load for Education students for the entire summer session\nis 12. Session-specific limits follow the rule of one credit per week\nof instruction, except nine credits are allowed in the Eight-Week\nGeneral Session. Students must obtain permission from an academic\ndean\u00a0to carry an overload in any of the summer sessions; start this\nprocess by completing the Credit Overload Request Form (https://\nuwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a5bKn4mlGaeCnpb/).\nDirected/Independent Study\nDirected Study, also called\u00a0Independent\u00a0Study,\u00a0offers the student\nan opportunity to work with a School of Education faculty member\non an individual topic of interest. Most School of Education\ndepartments make directed study courses available to students on\nthe basis of the student's preparation and motivation and a faculty\nmember's willingness to accept the student in such an endeavor.\nDirected Study courses are generally numbered 199, 299, 399, and\n699.\nThis study option is intended primarily for advanced students who\nhave a depth of knowledge in a field, the self-discipline necessary for\nindependent work, and strong motivation to pursue a special project.\nSome program areas limit the number of Directed Study credits that\ncan be applied to\u00a0major or minor requirements.\nDirected Study is taken as a supplement to, but not as a replacement\nfor, available course offerings. In this way, it may be used to expand\nareas of particularly strong interest.

Faculty and dean's offices may have some\ndiscretion in permitting courses to count for requirements even when\nthey are not coded as exactly equivalent; students should see their\nStudent Services advisor.\nConcurrent Enrollment\nUW Extension is an entirely separate institution from UW\u2013Madison.\nThus, UW\u2013Madison students must have permission from their\nacademic dean to be enrolled concurrently in another higher\neducation institution. Permission for concurrent enrollment is\ngranted routinely for School of Education students through the\nSchool of Education Student Services office. Students should go\nto the Registrar's Office's website for the permission form. The\ncompleted form indicates permission for concurrent enrollment and,\nin some circumstances, provides for a waiver of the tuition for the\nIndependent Learning course (see additional information below).\nStudents should take this form to the School of Education Student\nServices office, 139 Education Building, 1000 Bascom Mall, and\nmeet\u00a0with an advisor. Send it to Independent Learning after it has\nbeen approved at the School of Education Student Services office.\nTuition Waiver\nThe tuition for an Independent Learning course may be waived\nwith the academic dean's permission, although the student is still\nresponsible for other course enrollment fees. Students are eligible\nfor a tuition waiver if they register for an Independent Learning\ncourse during the semester they are concurrently enrolled at UW\u2013\nMadison. In some cases, students may\u00a0be allowed to register for\nIndependent Learning classes once they have enrolled in courses\nfor the subsequent semester, linking their Independent Learning\nregistration with the credits for the succeeding semester. Students\ninterested in receiving a tuition waiver must be enrolled full time (at\nleast 12 credits) at UW\u2013Madison, and\u00a0have no more than 18 credits\nafter adding the Independent Learning course. Students should see\ntheir Student Services advisor for additional information on these\npolicies. Complete the form\u00a0and submit it to the School of Education\nStudent Services office, 139 Education Building, 1000 Bascom Mall.\nThis stamped form must then be sent to Independent Learning, with\na copy remaining at Student Services.\nPosting Independent Learning Courses to the UW\u2013Madison\nTranscript\nIndependent Learning courses are posted to the campus transcript\nafter staff at the Office of Admissions and Recruitment (http://\nadmissions.wisc.edu) receive the original transcript. An official\ntranscript for an Independent Learning course must be submitted to\nthis office.\nTiming for Course Completion and Degree Posting\nIndependent Learning courses require a substantial time\ncommitment.\u00a0Students should not\u00a0plan to begin an Independent\nLearning course only a few weeks before it must be completed!\nPerhaps even more important, students completing an\u00a0Independent\nLearning course to meet degree requirements during their last\nsemester on campus\u00a0should be aware that the Independent\nLearning course must be completed prior to\u00a0the University's\nofficial graduation date for that semester. The completion date\nlisted on the UW Extension transcript\u00a0must be on or before the\nUW\u2013Madison degree completion date or the\u00a0student's degree\nwill be awarded\u00a0after\u00a0the subsequent semester. For example, if a\nstudent's UW Extension transcript indicates a course completion\ndate of May 25 but the UW\u2013Madison degree completion date is\nMay 23, the student's degree will be posted for the subsequent\nAugust graduation date, not for the May graduation day. This could\ncreate serious problems for teacher education students hoping to\nsecure a position. For this reason, students completing final degree\nrequirements via Independent Learning should consult carefully with\nStudent Services and Independent Learning\u00a0staff regarding the\ntiming of their course completion and degree posting.\nLate Course Adds or Drops\nCourse enrollment regulations must be followed when adding\nand dropping courses. Students are responsible for knowing and\ncomplying with the published deadlines; see the Office of the\nRegistrar's website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dates/)\u00a0for deadlines.\nStudents are expected to check their academic records routinely to\nminimize the need for late drops based on enrollment errors.\nLate Course Add\nStudents must obtain instructor, departmental, and dean's approval\nto add a course after the course add deadline.

The number of credits carried each\nsemester may depend upon a student's preparation, motivation,\ncourse selection, employment, and extracurricular activities.\nDegree Audit Reporting System (DARS)\nUW\u2013Madison uses \u201cDARS\u201d to document a student's progress toward\nthe completion of their degree, including any additional majors and\ncertificates. A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nDual Degrees\nStudents may be permitted to complete two degrees simultaneously.\nFor example, students may complete two degree programs in\nthe School of Education or may choose a degree program in the\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences along with their School\nof Education degree. Not all schools/colleges permit dual degrees\n\u2014 e.g., this is not permitted by the College of Letters & Science\nor by the College of Engineering. Students should confer with an\nacademic dean\u00a0regarding the ability and feasibility of completing\ntwo degrees programs simultaneously. Students wishing to earn two\nundergraduate degrees must follow these academic policies:\n\u2022 If the two degrees to be earned are within the School of\nEducation, at least 30 additional credits and all course and\ngrade point average requirements for the second degree\nmust be completed for the second degree. When the first\ndegree requires 120 credits, a minimum of 150 credits for\nmost majors will be required.

Required\ncourses cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis. The School\nof Education may reject pass/fail requests for non-elective\nwork, but it is the student\u2019s responsibility to be sure that the\nrequested course is an elective. Courses taken on a pass/fail\nbasis will not count for non-elective requirements\u2014even if they\nwould normally count toward such requirements.\nStudents may submit pass/fail requests via their Student\nCenter link from the time that they register until midnight\non the Friday at the end of the fourth week of fall and spring\nsemesters. For modular and summer session courses, pass/fail\nrequests must be submitted by midnight Friday of the week\nin which the session is one-fourth completed. Students may\nnot cancel or add the pass/fail option after the deadline for\nsubmitting Pass/Fail Option Forms.\nInstructors are not notified when a student elects the pass/\nfail option (Students can see whether a course is pass/fail in\ntheir Student Center). When a course is taken on a pass/fail\nbasis, the instructor reports a letter grade, which is converted\nby the registrar to an S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory).\nThe grade of S shall be recorded by the registrar in place of\ninstructors' grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C. The grade of U shall\nbe recorded by the registrar in place of instructors' grades of\nD or F. Neither the S nor the U is used in computing the grade-\npoint average.

GEO works within the SoE\nand with the broader campus community to facilitate experiences such as\nstudy abroad, study away (within the United States and U.S. territories),\nor international internship opportunities. GEO can help a student navigate\nthese processes.\nStudy Abroad, Study Away, and International\nInternships\nGEO works with the International Academic Programs (IAP) (https://\nstudyabroad.wisc.edu/) office (301 Red Gym, 716 Langdon Street,\n608-265-6329) to provide SoE students with opportunities that fit\ntheir specific needs. IAP is the central study abroad, study away, and\ninternational internship office at UW\u2013Madison. IAP offers over 200 study\nabroad options in over 60 countries on six continents. Together, GEO and\nIAP provide information about academics, funding, and health and safety\nto make participating in a global opportunity possible.\nGlobal Opportunities and Resources\nSoE - IAP Signature Study Abroad or Away Programs\n\u2022 The SoE has developed faculty-led short-term summer and\nwinter break abroad and away opportunities specifically designed\nfor SoE students to earn credits for their field of study. In 2025,\nthe SoE offered twelve short-term summer programs around the\nglobe. Programs vary each year. For a complete list of programs,\nvisit the GEO website (https://global.education.wisc.edu/study-\nabroad/).\nHelp with Course Planning and Timing\nAdvising and Earning Credit\n\u2022 Many SoE academic departments have created Major\nAdvising Pages (MAPs) (https://studyabroad.wisc.edu/\nacademics/major-advising-pages-maps/). MAPs are a\nguide to the academic requirements of specific majors in\nrelation to study abroad or study away programs. While\nmany programs include language training, many IAP\nprograms have no language requirement and include\ncourses taught in English.\n\u2022 All courses taken abroad through IAP count as \u201cin-\nresidence\u201d credit, just like taking courses on campus at\nUW-Madison. In addition to the classroom experience,\nmany students also complete internships and do research,\nfieldwork, and service learning.\nWhen to Study or Intern Abroad or Study Away\n\u2022 Studying and interning abroad or away is open throughout\nthe undergraduate years. However, for some majors,\ngoing early is the best option. For example, in the SoE,\nteacher education and kinesiology have structured course\nsequences in the junior and senior years. Studying abroad\nor away during the first two years may be the best option\nfor students in these program areas.\n\u2022 SoE students, and students pursuing a certificate in\nthe SoE, are encouraged to explore different global\nexperiences early, even during their first or second\nsemester on campus.\n\u2022 Review the MAPs and meet with advisors in the SoE or\nIAP to determine the most suitable time to participate and\nidentify the location that is right for you.\nFinancing a Study Abroad or Away Experience\n\u2022 Learn more about funding on the IAP Scholarship webpage\n(https://studyabroad.wisc.edu/funding/scholarships/) and\non the GEO website (https://global.education.wisc.edu/\nstudy-abroad/). Working with the IAP, International\nInternships, Financial Aid, and GEO early allows students\nto explore many scholarship options.

The lab descriptions often contain\ncontact information for students interested in getting\ninvolved in the lab's activities. The Kinesiology department\n(https://kinesiology.education.wisc.edu/research/) and\nthe Communication Sciences and Disorders department\n(https://csd.wisc.edu/research/) are two good examples of\nhow this information is shared. Many School of Education\nstudents participate in research through the Department of\nEducational Psychology.\n\u2022 The Student Jobs (https://studentjobs.wisc.edu/) website\nlists some research opportunities.\n\u2022 Read the online bios of professors to learn about their\nareas of research. Send an email inquiry. The Center for\nPre-Health Advising (https://prehealth.wisc.edu/research-\nopportunities/) has a helpful email template you may use.\n\u2022 Ask the professor or TA in a class if they know of any\nopportunities to become involved with research.\nParticipate When Enrolled in a Course\n\u2022 Some courses have research opportunities built into the\ncourse itself. For example:\n\u2022 BIOLOGY/BOTANY/ZOOLOGY\u00a0\u00a0152 has provided students\nwith an option to participate in a mentored research\nopportunity.\u00a0\n\u2022 Students can serve as research participants to earn extra\ncredit in their courses.

This check is intended to determine if the\napplicant has engaged in any behavior that endangers the health, welfare,\nsafety, or education of PK-12 pupils. Local school districts frequently\nconduct background checks on teacher education students prior to\nthe start of their in-classroom field work, and the Department of Public\nInstruction (DPI) will also conduct a background check on each applicant\nfor a Wisconsin educator license.\nStudents should be aware that background checks may be initiated by\nother agencies or organizations when they are seeking employment\nor a professional license. School administrators have the authority to\ndetermine the appropriateness of a student placement and may choose\nnot to permit a placement based on a student\u2019s background check results.\nAn individual who has been deemed ineligible to participate in field or\nclinical experiences based on the results of their background check may\nnot be able to complete the requirements for their degree or certification.\nStudents with questions about these processes should contact the\nTeacher Education Center, tec@education.wisc.edu.\nREQUIREMENTS\nUNIVERSITY GENERAL\nEDUCATION REQUIREMENTS\nAll undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are\nrequired to fulfill a minimum set of common\u00a0university general education\nrequirements to ensure that every graduate acquires the essential core\nof an undergraduate education.

The program\naddresses the fundamentals of art through investigation of formal,\ntechnical and conceptual issues. The drawing, 2D and 3D design, digital\nmedia, and art historical lecture classes are designed to expose, broaden,\nand challenge students' understanding of contemporary art production.\nArt foundations classes are meant to be taken concurrently and the\ninformation covered in them is interrelated. Students completing the\nfoundations program\u00a0should enroll in ART\u00a0102 2D Foundations, ART\u00a0212\nDrawing Foundations, and ART\u00a0108 Foundations of Contemporary Art\nfor the fall semester and complete ART\u00a0104 3D Foundations, ART\u00a0107\nIntroduction to Digital Forms, and ART\u00a0208 Current Directions in Art in the\nspring.\nMost freshman art majors complete their foundations courses through\nparticipation in the very popular\u00a0Contemporary Art and Artists First-\nYear Interest Group (FIG), (https://figs.wisc.edu/) which also creates a\nnetwork of corresponding experiences and a peer community that will\ncontinue throughout the program and often beyond graduation. Students\nin FIGs enjoy studying with instructors dedicated to serving first year\nstudents, the opportunity to integrate related ideas from all three classes,\nand the ready-made opportunities to form support networks and lasting\nfriendships.\nAdditional information about the Foundations Program (https://\nart.wisc.edu/media-disciplines/foundations/) is available on the\ndepartmental website.\nAESTHETICS REQUIREMENT\nComplete four courses focusing on the history of art and contemporary\ndevelopments in the visual arts.\nCode\nTitle\nCredits\nART\u00a0108\nFoundations of Contemporary Art\n3\nART\u00a0208\nCurrent Directions in Art\n3\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0202\nHistory of Western Art II: From\nRenaissance to Contemporary\n4\nSelect one of the following: 1\n3-4\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0103\nTopics in Art History (world art\ntopics)\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0104\nThe Art of Diversity: Race and\nRepresentation in the Art and Visual\nCulture of the United States\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0205\nGlobal Arts\nART\u00a0HIST/\nAFROAMER\u00a0\u00a0241\nIntroduction to African Art and\nArchitecture\nART\u00a0HIST/\nAFROAMER\u00a0\u00a0242\nIntroduction to Afro-American Art\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0305\nHistory of Islamic Art and\nArchitecture\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0307\nFrom Tomb to Temple: Ancient\nChinese Art and Religion in\nTransition\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0308\nThe Tastes of Scholars and\nEmperors: Chinese Art in the Later\nPeriods\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0354\nCross-Cultural Arts Around the\nAtlantic Rim: 1800 to the Present\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0411\nTopics in Asian Art\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0412\nTopics in African and African\nDiaspora Art History\nART\u00a0HIST/\nASIAN\u00a0\u00a0428\nVisual Cultures of India\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0440\nArt and Power in the Arab World\nART\u00a0HIST\u00a0475\nJapanese Ceramics and Allied Arts\n1 Additional art history courses addressing arts from underrepresented\ncultures will be considered.\u00a0A course may also count for the global\nperspectives or ethnic studies requirement if it has that designation.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nFOUR-YEAR PLAN\nBachelor of Fine Arts: Art - Graphic Design Named Option\nSample Four-Year Plan\nThis four-year sample graduation plan is designed to guide your course\nselection throughout your academic career; it does not establish a\ncontractual agreement. Use it along with your DARS report, the Guide,\nand the Course Search and Enroll app to create a four-year plan reflecting\nyour placement scores, incoming credits, and individual interests. Consult\nwith your academic advisor(s) to develop a personalized plan of study and\nrefer to the Guide for a complete list of requirements.

Students\ntake courses in areas\u00a0of particular interest and\u00a0also have an opportunity\nto sample\u00a0the\u00a0wide selection of courses offered across the university.\nCoursework is required in humanities, social studies, science, and cultural\nand historical studies. Some elective\u00a0coursework is also needed to reach\nthe required number of credits.\nThe School of Education\u2019s\u00a0Liberal Studies\nRequirements\u00a0automatically satisfy most of the University\nGeneral Education Requirements outlined above, including ethnic\nstudies, humanities/literature, social studies, and science. Students\npursuing most School of Education degree programs may also complete\nCommunication Part B, Quantitative Reasoning Part A, and Quantitative\nReasoning Part B through courses required by their degree program.\nIf a student cannot complete a General Education Requirement within\nthe curriculum of their chosen School of Education program, academic\nadvisors can offer suggestions for courses that meet the requirement and\naugment the student\u2019s primary area of study.\nA basic outline of the liberal studies is included below.

The university-wide General Education requirements also\nencourage this breadth of study.\n\u2022 The Foundations Program requires six interrelated studio and\naesthetics courses designed to prepare first-year students for further\nstudy in studio art and design.\n\u2022 Aesthetics coursework gives students an opportunity to study both the\nhistory of art and contemporary developments in the visual arts.\n\u2022 Major requirements permit in-depth studies of studio art. After taking\ncourses in the Foundations area, students complete coursework in\neach of the four studio areas: 2D, 3D, 4D, and Graphics. BS\u2013Art majors\nare required to reach an advanced level in at least one studio discipline.\n\u2022 Elective credits to pursue individual areas of interest, such as a second\nmajor or additional studio credits. Many BS\u2013Art students complete an\nadditional major from the College of Letters & Science. Some use this\nmajor to complement their art preparation (e.g., focusing on written\ncommunication for an eventual career in\u00a0advertising),\u00a0or a subject\nthat complements their interest in art.\u00a0Students\u00a0interested in medical\nillustration, for example, may wish to take courses in the biological\nsciences. Others select majors that reflect interests completely\nunrelated to art.\nART FOUNDATIONS PROGRAM\nThe\u00a0Art\u00a0Foundations Program\u00a0is a series of interrelated studio and lecture\ncourses to be taken by art and art education majors in their first year\nas preparation for further study in studio art and design. The program\naddresses the fundamentals of art through investigation of formal,\ntechnical and conceptual issues. The drawing, 2D and 3D design, digital\nmedia, and art historical lecture classes are designed to expose, broaden,\nand challenge students' understanding of contemporary art production.\nArt foundations classes are meant to be taken concurrently and the\ninformation covered in them is interrelated. Students completing the\nFoundations Program\u00a0should enroll in ART\u00a0102 2D Foundations, ART\u00a0212\nDrawing Foundations, and ART\u00a0108 Foundations of Contemporary Art\nfor the fall semester and complete ART\u00a0104 3D Foundations, ART\u00a0107\nIntroduction to Digital Forms, and ART\u00a0208 Current Directions in Art in the\nspring.\nMost freshman art majors complete their foundations courses through\nparticipation in the very popular\u00a0Contemporary Art and Artists First-\nYear Interest Group (FIG), (https://figs.wisc.edu/) which also creates a", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

This classification\nindicates that a student is interested in a program offered by the\nschool, but has not applied and been admitted to the professional\nprogram. Students interested in communication sciences and\ndisorders receive the \"pre-professional\" classification of PRS.\nOn-campus students wishing to be admitted to the school while\nworking on eligibility requirements and application can apply\nfor admission to the school by completing a\u00a0Pre-Professional\nApplication (http://www.education.wisc.edu/soe/academics/\nundergraduate-students/academic-program-admission/). A\nminimum GPA of 2.5, based on UW\u2013Madison coursework, is required\nto transfer into the school. This GPA may be modified by the Last\n60 Credits rule (detailed below (p.\u00a01561)).\u00a0It is not necessary to\nbe a \"pre-professional\u201d student before applying to a professional\nprogram.\nIt is strongly recommended that students interested in a School of\nEducation program meet with an academic advisor in the School\nof Education Student Services office, 139 Education Building, 1000\nBascom Mall.

Our\nprogram prides itself on preparing successful educators in a socially just\nand equitable manner, and job placement is exceptionally high.\nThe Elementary Education professional sequence is a two-year\ncommitment, typically starting in the fall of the junior year, although\nsome courses may be taken in the sophomore year. Coursework and field\nexperiences lead to the capstone experience of student teaching.\nOur graduates become teacher leaders committed to teaching all children\neffectively and advancing justice through classroom practices, personal\ninteractions, and community engagement. We teach research-based\npractices that assist teachers throughout their careers in education.\nStudents are encouraged to get involved as soon as they arrive on\ncampus, and we have a variety of ways for this to happen. Many\neducation-related courses are open to freshmen and sophomores.\nThe School of Education's Buddy Program, in which new students\nare paired with a junior or senior in the program, helps students find a\nsupportive community on our Big Ten campus. Many students volunteer\nin local schools and community organizations, including Schools of\nHope (https://schoolsofhope.org/). We also welcome you to join our\nactive chapter of Aspiring Educators (https://www.facebook.com/\nAspiringEducatorsUWMadison/), a pre-professional educators\nassociation.\nUW\u2013Madison's Elementary Education program trains teachers to\nrecognize, appreciate, and value the wide range of gifts diverse students\nbring to our increasingly multicultural, complex world.\nSee what an elementary education professor and a teacher candidate\nhave to say about the Elementary Education Program (https://\nwww.youtube.com/watch/?v=uCKP1VGrC3k) at UW\u2013Madison.\nCERTIFICATION OPTIONS\nThe Elementary Education area offers five certification options, giving\nstudents many choices as they plan their career paths. All certification\noptions are designed to be completed in four semesters after program\nadmission and some classes may be taken prior to starting the professional\nsequence. Students are admitted once a year and begin the four-semester\nprofessional sequence in the following fall.

This check is intended to determine if the\napplicant has engaged in any behavior that endangers the health, welfare,\nsafety, or education of PK-12 pupils. Local school districts frequently\nconduct background checks on teacher education students prior to\nthe start of their in-classroom field work, and the Department of Public\nInstruction (DPI) will also conduct a background check on each applicant\nfor a Wisconsin educator license.\nStudents should be aware that background checks may be initiated by\nother agencies or organizations when they are seeking employment\nor a professional license. School administrators have the authority to\ndetermine the appropriateness of a student placement and may choose\nnot to permit a placement based on a student\u2019s background check results.\nAn individual who has been deemed ineligible to participate in field or\nclinical experiences based on the results of their background check may\nnot be able to complete the requirements for their degree or certification.\nStudents with questions about these processes should contact the\nTeacher Education Center, tec@education.wisc.edu.\nREQUIREMENTS\nUNIVERSITY GENERAL\nEDUCATION REQUIREMENTS\nAll undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are\nrequired to fulfill a minimum set of common\u00a0university general education\nrequirements to ensure that every graduate acquires the essential core\nof an undergraduate education.

Certificate students work\nboth independently and in small teams to develop a portfolio of board\ngames, video games, and physical spaces. The certificate focuses on\ncreating, testing, and understanding how to design gameplay to be fun\nand impactful.\nWHAT WILL STUDENTS GAIN?\nStudents acquire the skills, understanding, and background to create and\nproduce games independently, develop a body of work, and gain critical\nperspectives on games and game design.\nHOW DO I GET INVOLVED?\nInterested students may wish to consult with an advisor in the School of\nEducation Student Services office, 139 Education Building, 608-262-1651,\nor\u00a0studentservices@wisc.edu (studentservices@education.wisc.edu), to\ndiscuss course sequencing, declaring, and other issues related to this field\nof study.

The\nprogram prepares students to teach a variety of subject matters including\nand beyond academics that revolve around student interests and job-\nsite demands. It fosters skills for working with a wide age range spectrum\nfrom children to adults and builds confidence in entering new spaces,\nasking critical questions, and designing robust lessons that meet expected\nlearning goals. Students will engage with multiple models of culturally\nresponsive teaching while critically examining challenges to such models in\ndifferent global contexts.\nThrough this certificate, students will explore the complexities of formal\nand informal education beyond U.S. pedagogical frameworks, identifying\nand analyzing both mainstream and contested narratives about education\nin non-U.S. settings and their implications for lesson planning. Coursework\nand field experiences will provide opportunities to:\n\u2022 Prepare culturally responsive lessons and participate in cross-\ncultural field experiences, considering the role of power in\nconstructions such as race, gender, disability, socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), and language.\n\u2022 Examine educational thought in both informal and formal\neducation settings, reflecting on how different traditions and\nsystems shape teaching and learning.\n\u2022 Engage in fieldwork in U.S. settings in person and in non-U.S.\nsettings virtually to reflect on issues of teaching, curriculum, and\nlearning across cultural contexts.\n\u2022 Analyze power relations in education, paying close attention to\ncolonial legacies, hierarchies, and assumptions about difference\nthat emerge in cross-cultural teaching.\nThe certificate is open to all domestic and international undergraduate\nstudents seeking to develop skills in analyzing cultural contexts,\nplanning instruction, designing curriculum, and teaching in professional\ncommunities beyond the U.S. While it does not lead to a K-12 public school\nteaching license, it enhances competitiveness for international teaching\npositions and strengthens applications for Fulbright ETA, Peace Corps,\ninternational internships, and study abroad programs.\nThe certificate is also a gateway to post-undergraduate study\nopportunities in education. Its content is not restricted by state-based\nteacher education requirements, making it valuable preparation for\ngraduate programs and teaching assistantships in the field of education\nmore broadly.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function.

Advisors in Education\nStudent Services, Room 139 Education Building, 1000 Bascom Mall,\n608-262-1651, can discuss students' interests and help frame the\nwritten narrative required of the major. Current students can schedule\nan appointment with an advisor online through the Starfish app (https://\nadvising.wisc.edu/facstaff/starfish/starfish-student-resources/) in MyUW.\nApplicants must develop a narrative describing the proposed course of\nstudy and its related career goals. Information should be included which\nwill enable a faculty committee to identify the relationship among the\nproposed program of study, a general interest in education, and career\ngoals. A program title cannot duplicate the existing title of any program at\nUW\u2013Madison.\nSELECTION OF MAJOR COURSEWORK\nSelect courses that support the program narrative, in consultation with\nthe major advisor; see below. All courses in the major must be from\nSchool of Education course offerings. All credits in the major must be\ncompleted after admission into the program (IME classification).\nAdditional requirements regarding the major are:\n\u2022 To ensure depth and breadth of study, no more than two-thirds of\nthe total credits in a major can be taken from any one department\n(i.e., if a major is 36 credits, no more than 24 credits can be in one\ndepartment).\n\u2022 A sequential development of courses must be planned in consultation\nwith the major advisor and committee, and must be approved by the\ncommittee. The course sequence must include beginning through\nadvanced levels of work as prescribed by the credit distribution.\n\u2022 At least 20 of the IME credits must be at the intermediate or advanced\nlevels (generally numbered 300 or above, but this varies in some\ndepartments).\n\u2022 Courses in the School of Education completed prior to admission to\nthe IME classification may not be used toward satisfaction of the 36\u2013\n42 credits in the major without the faculty committee and associate\ndean's approval.

Only assistant, associate, and full professors may serve on the\ncommittee; individuals holding such titles as Lecturer or Instructor cannot\nserve in this capacity. One of the committee members will be selected\nby the student to be the major advisor.

Degree candidates must complete their last 30\ncredits in residence on the UW\u2013Madison campus.\nDEGREE AUDIT (DARS)\nUW\u2013Madison uses \u201cDARS\u201d to document a student's progress toward\nthe completion of their degree, including any additional majors and\ncertificates. A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nUNIVERSITY DEGREE\nREQUIREMENTS\u00a0\nTotal Degree\nTo receive a bachelor's degree from UW\u2013Madison,\nstudents must earn a minimum of 120 degree credits.\nThe requirements for some programs may exceed 120\ndegree credits.

A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nUNIVERSITY DEGREE\nREQUIREMENTS\nTotal Degree\nTo receive a bachelor's degree from UW\u2013Madison,\nstudents must earn a minimum of 120 degree credits.\nThe requirements for some programs may exceed 120\ndegree credits.

These students have a\nweekly meeting with the instructional staff to cover common challenges\nin the content and to go over the plan for the study groups, including\ncommunity building, active learning, and peer facilitation strategies. This\nis not a tutoring session, but a peer-led facilitation of learning by asking\nquestions and helping the students work with the material in new ways.\nThe new KinEqT mentorship program is organized by graduate\nstudents to help undergraduate students connect and build community\nin the Department. The program helps facilitate mentorship\nand#access to#resources\u2013both academic and professional\u2013between\ngraduate and undergraduate students with underrepresented racial,\ndisability, social class and gender identities, especially those who\nare#underrepresented#within the UW-Madison Department of\nKinesiology.\nCommunity-Based Learning Experiences\nThe Kinesiology Practicum is a Community Based Learning Course and\nis structured for students to gain experience and skills outside of the\nclassroom. This is one of the highlights of the major. Students are placed\nin a relevant setting for their career goals and spend approximately seven\nhours per week working with these partners.

We\nbelieve great PE teachers help students grow into healthy, happy,\nand helpful humans. Our unique PE teacher preparation program has\ndedicated faculty with decades of experience who are committed to\nguiding you to be the best teacher you can be.\nThe Physical Education program is not one of the larger programs in the\nstate, but we think it is one of the best. More than once, a retired Health\nand Physical Education Curriculum Director from a school district in\nWisconsin told us our graduates are better prepared than students coming\nout of any other program. We feel good about that.\nIn addition to the Physical Education major, we also offer a minor in\nAdapted Physical Education (p.\u00a01655) and a minor in Health Education\n(p.\u00a01656). The Adapted minor is important for teaching at all levels and\nthe Health minor is important for teaching at the secondary level. You can\ndevelop the program to fit your needs and graduate with just the Physical\nEducation major, the major and one minor, or the major and both minors.\nThe UW\u2013Madison School of Education Teacher Pledge (https://\ntec.education.wisc.edu/teacher-pledge/) can financially support your\ndreams of becoming a teacher. You pledge to teach in Wisconsin PK-12\nschools for 3-4 years after graduation. In return, we pledge to pay the\nequivalent of in-state tuition and fees, testing, and licensing costs.\nWe are committed to transforming physical education into a powerful\nexperience in which students develop physical, mental, and social skills for\nlife. To that end, our program includes the following elements:\n\u2022 Standards-based curriculum models\n\u2022 Culturally responsive teaching techniques in inclusive and\nmulticultural settings\n\u2022 Social and emotional learning that incorporates community\nbuilding and behavior management\nPhysical education students also benefit from:\n\u2022 Nationally and state-recognized faculty and staff members\n\u2022 Student teaching placements in urban, suburban, or rural\nsettings, depending on the needs of the individual\n\u2022 Small class sizes and advising groups\n\u2022 A strong science and technology-based curriculum\n\u2022 Instruction within the #1 nationally ranked UW\u2013Madison School\nof Education\nFrom the beginning, you will get to work with students from diverse\neducational backgrounds, ensuring you will be prepared to thrive in\nany setting after graduation. We offer many \"out-of-the-classroom\"\nopportunities to strengthen and expand your physical education\nknowledge, and proudly have a presence in Special Olympics, adapted\nclubs, and local Boys & Girls Clubs.\nYou'll also have a chance to study abroad and take our team-building\ncourse in Costa Rica! We go every May after the spring semester, and\nour students learn how to create a safe, inclusive learning community in a\nunique cultural setting.\nThroughout the Physical Education program, you\u2019ll observe PE teachers,\nteam-teach homeschooled elementary students, and participate in\ncommunity service opportunities in the Madison area.

They spend their\ninitial semesters completing liberal studies, general education, and science\ncore requirements.\nUW-Madison students who started in another major can move to Pre-\nPhysical Education by completing a Pre-Professional Declaration (http://\nwww.education.wisc.edu/soe/academics/undergraduate-students/\nacademic-program-admission/). A GPA of 2.75, based on all UW\u2013Madison\ncoursework or the last 60 credits (p.\u00a01494), is required to transfer into\nPre-Physical Education.\nIt is not necessary to be a Pre-Physical Education student before declaring\nthe Bachelor of Science in Physical Education.\nDECLARING BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION (BSPE)\nOn-Campus Students\nOn-campus students may declare the Bachelor of Science in Physical\nEducation degree at any time, provided they have met the following\nrequirements:\n\u2022 Have second-year academic standing.\n\u2022 Earned a minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA (4.00 scale)\non all college work attempted, or a 2.75 on the last 60\ncredits (https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/education/\n#policiesandregulationstext).\n\u2022 Have met with a Physical Education or School of Education\nStudent Services advisor who will submit the declaration form;\nsee Contact Information for details.\n1 Last 60 Credits Rule - Two grade point averages may be calculated to\ndetermine a candidate's eligibility to declare Physical Education. A GPA\nmay be calculated using (1) UW-Madison and all other all transferable\ncollege level coursework attempted and (2) the last 60 credits\nattempted. The higher GPA of these two calculations will be used for\ndetermining eligibility. Once declared, students must earn a semester\nGPA of 2.75 each semester after declaration. More information on this\nrule is available\u00a0here (p.\u00a01494).\nOff-Campus Transfers to UW-Madison\nOff-campus students wishing to transfer to UW-Madison and declare\nthe Bachelor of Science in Physical Education degree must be admitted\nto UW-Madison. Admission to the university has its own application,\nadmission process, and application deadlines; see\u00a0Office of Admissions\nand Recruitment (http://www.admissions.wisc.edu/) for application\ninformation.\u00a0Students also need to meet with a Physical Education or\nSchool of Education Student Services advisor, who will determine if the\nfollowing eligibility requirements to declare the BSPE degree have been\nmet:\n\u2022 Have second year academic standing.\n\u2022 Earned a minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA (4.00 scale) on\nall college work attempted or 2.75 on the last 60 credits\n(https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/education/\n#policiesandregulationstext).\nSee Contact Information for details. The advisor will submit the\ndeclaration form if the student has met the eligibility requirements.\nTransfer students who do not meet the declaration eligibility requirements\nmay be admitted to UW-Madison with the Pre-Physical Education\nclassification.\nStudents with a Previous Undergraduate Degree\nStudents who already hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree and wish to become\ncertified to teach Physical Education must be admitted to UW-Madison.\nAdmission to the university has its own application, admission process, and\napplication deadlines; see\u00a0Office of Admissions and Recruitment (http://\nwww.admissions.wisc.edu) for university application information.\nStudents need to meet with a Physical Education or School of Education\nStudent Services advisor who will (1) review the student's eligibility to\ndeclare the BSPE degree, and (2) discuss their admission status, see\nbelow. Eligibility requires that a student has:\n\u2022 Earned a minimum 2.75 cumulative GPA (4.00 scale) on\nall college work attempted or 2.75 on the last 60 credits\n(https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/education/\n#policiesandregulationstext).\nSee Contact Information for details. The advisor will submit the\ndeclaration form if the student has met the eligibility requirement.\nAn applicant with a previous undergraduate degree will be admitted\nto Physical Education as a second degree candidate or as a School of\nEducation \"Special Student,\" depending on their academic background.\nSecond degree candidates in the School of Education are changing their\nacademic direction and wish to complete a degree that is unrelated\nto their first degree.

A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION\nREQUIREMENTS AND APPLYING\nFOR A LICENSE\nIn addition to completing UW-Madison's program requirements,\nstudents must also complete Wisconsin statutory requirements and\ncertification requirements established by the Wisconsin Department of\nPublic Instruction. Many of these requirements are embedded within\nthe program's requirements and require no additional attention.

The on-campus declaration form is\nlocated on the School of Education's Undergraduate Admissions (http://\nwww.education.wisc.edu/soe/academics/undergraduate-students/\nacademic-program-admission/) page, along with information about\nthe declaration period, deadline, and current eligibility requirements.\nStudents should consult this site prior to submitting a declaration, as this\ninformation may be modified from one declaration year to the next.\nOff-campus students wishing to transfer directly into Elementary\nEducation and Special Education should complete the on-campus\ndeclaration and must also be admitted to UW-Madison. See Transfer\nStudents and Students with a Previous Degree, below.\nCurrent Eligibility Requirements\n\u2022 Complete at least 40 transferable college-level credits by the\nend of the fall semester of the declaration year.\n\u2022 Successfully complete\u00a0RP\u00a0&\u00a0SE\u00a0300 Individuals with Disabilities\nby the end of the summer of the declaration year.\n\u2022 Earn a minimum 2.5 grade point average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale on\nall transferable college-level coursework attempted.1\n\u2022 Submit all program declaration form(s), transcripts, and other\nrelated declaration materials by the deadline\u00a0specified on the\nSchool of Education's Undergraduate Admissions (http://\nwww.education.wisc.edu/soe/academics/undergraduate-\nstudents/academic-program-admission/) page.\n1 Last 60 Credits Rule - Two grade point averages may be calculated to\ndetermine a candidate's eligibility to declare. A GPA may be calculated\nusing (1) UW-Madison and all other all transferable college level\ncoursework attempted and (2) the last 60 credits attempted. The higher\nGPA of these two calculations will be used for determining eligibility. Once\ndeclared, students must earn a semester GPA of 2.75 each semester after\ndeclaration. More information on this rule is available\u00a0here (p.\u00a01494).\nTRANSFER STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WITH\nA PREVIOUS DEGREE\nTransfer students and students who already hold a bachelor\u2019s degree must\nbe admitted to UW-Madison to enroll in a School of Education program.\nAdmission to the campus has its own application, admission process, and\napplication deadlines; see\u00a0Office of Admissions and Recruitment (http://\nwww.admissions.wisc.edu) for campus application information.\nStudents wishing to enter directly into Elementary Education and Special\nEducation should complete both the on-campus declaration and the UW-\nMadison application. All eligibility requirements must be met. Transfers\nwho do not meet the declaration eligibility criteria will be admitted to\nUW-Madison with the Pre-Elementary Education and Special Education\ndesignation.\nAn applicant with a previous undergraduate degree will be admitted to\nEESE as a second degree candidate or as a School of Education \"Special\nStudent,\" depending on their academic background.\nSecond degree candidates in the School of Education are changing their\nacademic direction and wish to complete a degree that is unrelated to\ntheir first. A large number of credits are usually required to complete\nthe new degree requirements and a second degree is awarded upon its\ncompletion; more information is available\u00a0here (p.\u00a01494). Most applicants\nto EESE will be second degree candidates.\nIn rare cases a student may be admitted as an Education Special Student.\nAdmission with this designation indicates that they have an interest\nin pursuing teacher certification in Elementary Education and Special\nEducation and have already studied this subject area extensively during\ntheir initial degree. A student enrolls as an Education Special Student to\ncomplete the requirements that were not taken during the first degree;\nthese are assessed on a case by case basis. Another degree is not awarded\nfor this \"certification only\" coursework.\nAll off-campus students are strongly encouraged to meet with an\nadvisor in the School of Education Student Services office in advance\nof their declaration. Consultations are available in person, virtually,\nor via telephone; email studentservices@education.wisc.edu or call\n608-262-1651 to schedule an appointment.\nBACKGROUND CHECKS\nPursuant to State of Wisconsin law PI 34.018(2), the School of Education\nis required to administer a background check on all students entering\nteacher education programs.

The\nstrong partnership between the teacher candidate, their field supervisor,\nand the cooperating teacher in Madison-area schools ensures robust\nsupport from day one. Many graduates are offered teaching positions by\nthe schools where they completed their fieldwork.\nGuest Speakers\nGuest speakers contribute to learning in many EESE courses, providing\ninsights into the daily lives of individuals with disabilities and discussing the\nrange of community organizations that support and advocate for them.\nThrough these interactions, students gain a better understanding of how\nthese organizations operate and their broader social impact.\nAdditionally, a wide range of guest speakers participate in Special\nEducation practicum and student teaching seminars. These guests may\ninclude school district personnel, parents and family members, teachers,\nand individuals with disabilities.\nField Experiences\nStudents in the EESE program engage in multiple field experiences in\nK-12 schools, culminating in a full-time student teaching assignment.\nThese experiences allow students to apply their classroom learning in real-\nworld educational settings, enhancing their professional development and\ndeepening their learning beyond the classroom.\nPartnering with Community Organizations\nThe EESE team collaborates with local organizations to assist with food\ndelivery and support families in need. Students also volunteer with\norganizations like Special Olympics, Camp Kesem, and Girls on the Run,\nwhich empowers girls of all abilities to build social, emotional, and physical\nskills. These volunteer opportunities give students the chance to engage\nwith diverse community experiences, extending their learning beyond\nacademics and encouraging personal growth through service and active\ninvolvement.\nCommunity Employment\nThe Department of Rehabilitation Psychology and Special Education\nhas strong connections with the community. Students in the department\noften find both paid and volunteer opportunities in school and community\norganizations that serve children with disabilities and their families.\nExamples include the Schools of Hope Tutoring Program, Madison School\nand Community Recreation, and Gio\u2019s Garden.\nField Trips\nWhile completing field experiences, students enjoy trips to places in the\nMadison community, such as the Madison Children's Museum (https://\nmadisonchildrensmuseum.org/), Madison Public Library's Play Lab\n(https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/spaces/playlab/), Allen Centennial\nGarden (https://allencentennialgarden.wisc.edu/), Centro Hispano\n(https://www.micentro.org/), and the Madison Literacy Network (https://\nwww.litnetwork.org/).

A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.", "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "encoding_format": "float", "dimensions": 1024}}

A DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) report shows\nall the requirements for completing a degree and, against courses that\nare planned or completed, shows the requirements that have been met,\nand those that are unmet. A report can offer suggestions about courses\nthat may be taken to meet specific requirements and can assist in the\nacademic planning and enrollment process. Students can access a DARS\nreport in the Course Search & Enroll app or Student Center via My UW.\nDARS also has a \"what-if\" function. This feature makes it possible\nto request a DARS report as if pursuing another program, major, or\ncertificate. It is an excellent tool if considering a new or additional area of\nstudy. School of Education students in a pre-professional classification\nsuch as Pre-Elementary (PRE) or Pre-Kinesiology should request a \"what\nif\" DARS report of their professional program of interest.\nMore information on how to request a DARS report is available on the\nOffice of the Registrar\u2019s website (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/).\nDARS is not intended to replace student contact with academic advisors.\nIt creates more time in an advising appointment to discuss course options,\nresearch opportunities, graduate school, or issues of personal interest or\nconcern to students.\nDARS is used as the document of record for degree program, major, and\ncertificate completion in the School of Education.\nADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION\nREQUIREMENTS AND APPLYING\nFOR A LICENSE\nIn addition to completing UW-Madison's program requirements,\nstudents must also complete Wisconsin statutory requirements and\ncertification requirements established by the Wisconsin Department of\nPublic Instruction.

Students learn from faculty and staff who are professional\nartists, technicians, and scholars working actively in their fields, in\nan environment that is both supportive and challenging - combining\none-on-one mentoring, small classes, and opportunities for applied\nwork in production.\u00a0Theatre students develop skills in communication,\ncollaboration, and critical thinking, along with cultural and creative\ncompetencies which prepare them for successful careers in the\nprofessional theatre and entertainment industry, gaming, and education\nas well as for graduate studies and preparation for such fields as law,\ncommunications, business, and more.\nThe centerpiece of the department\u2019s curriculum is its production program,\nchiefly the University Theatre (UT) program, as well as a Second Stage\nprogram supporting experimental and student work. Through a year-round\nseason of productions, the Department of Theatre and Drama\u2019s University\nTheatre serves as a vibrant arena for experiential and collaborative\nlearning, engaging undergraduate students in embodied and hands-\non work, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in performance,\ntechnical theatre, and design for audiences on campus and locally.\nTheatre and Drama majors pursue a Bachelor of Science degree (p.\u00a01708)\nthrough the School of Education, with the flexibility to informally explore\nsuch areas as design, stage management, directing, acting, and theatre\ntechnology. For students with a specific interest in acting, the department\noffers the Acting Option (p.\u00a01713), a highly structured program designed\nto provide a deeper understanding of the craft and professional skills\nneeded for a career in acting or advanced theatre studies. Students in this\noption receive personalized mentoring and performance reviews at the\nend of each semester. Upon completion, this option is formally noted on\nthe student's transcript.\nAdmission to the Acting Option is by audition only.

Students who were enrolled in a School of\nHuman Ecology program before their absence from UW\u2013Madison will\nbe readmitted to that program, provided they were in good academic\nstanding when they left (i.e., not on probation, strict probation, or dropped\nby the university). Reentry applicants who were dropped by the university\nare asked to submit supplemental application materials. Instructions for\nthe supplemental application are sent after the student has submitted the\nonline reentry application.\nStudents who were previously enrolled in another UW\u2013Madison school\nor college will not be admitted directly to a School of Human Ecology\nprogram. They must apply for reentry to the university with another school\nor college \u2014 usually the school or college in which they were previously\nenrolled. Once readmitted to the university, students may apply to the\ndesired Human Ecology\u00a0program through the application process for that\nprogram. For information about the school's programs and application\nprocesses, see Applying to Human Ecology as an On-Campus Student\n(http://admissions.wisc.edu/apply-as-a-reentry-student/).\nIt is recommended that students who have been readmitted to\na School of Human Ecology program schedule an appointment\nwith an academic advisor in the Advising & Career Center (https://\nadvising.humanecology.wisc.edu/).\nWISCONSIN EXPERIENCE\nWISCONSIN EXPERIENCE\nINTERNSHIPS\nInternships are a vital part of student career development and a highly\nvalued component of the undergraduate curriculum in the School of\nHuman Ecology.

The expectation is for students to spend the\nyear away from campus to reflect on and resolve the issues that resulted\nin their poor academic performance. Students who were academically\ndropped from the university are eligible for readmission consideration\nafter one full calendar year. Students dropped for a third time will not be\nreadmitted.\nTo reenter the university after one full year, a student must apply for\nreadmission to the School of Human Ecology and for reentry to the\nuniversity. A student is never guaranteed readmission after being dropped.\nReadmission is most likely if the student has addressed the issues that\ncontributed to being dropped from the university and has a plan and\nresources to support a successful return.\nTo apply for readmission to Human Ecology\u00a0and the University of\nWisconsin\u2013Madison after being dropped, a student must follow these\nsteps:\n1.

Students interested in completing dual degrees should\nconsult with their academic advisor early in their academic career and\ncomplete a four-year plan to understand the feasibility of completing\nrequirements for both degrees. Earning a dual degree requires students to:\n1. Earn an additional 30 credits specific to the second major,\n2. Earn a minimum of 150 degree credits to graduate,\n3. Complete all curriculum requirements for both degrees,\n4. Ensure the two programs are substantially different from each other,\n5. Complete coursework in both programs simultaneously,\n6.

Retroactive credits, transfer credits, AP credits, and credits\ngranted by examination are not considered \"in residence.\"\nCREDIT OVERLOAD\nA full-time student credit load is 12 to 18 credits, with the most typical\ncredit load being 15 to 16 credits per fall/spring semester. A student\nwishing to enroll in more than 18 credits in a fall/spring semester or 12\ncredits in the summer must complete a Credit Overload Request (https://\nuwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8AI4WZBMjVSyMFD/) to\nobtain dean\u2019s approval. The maximum credits allowed with Dean's approval\nfor fall/spring term is 21 credits, and summer term is 13 credits. These\ncredit limits are inclusive of credits enrolled in at another institution, which\nmay result in credits not being accepted at UW\u2013Madison if approval is not\nsecured in advance. Students should speak with their academic advisor\nprior to requesting a credit overload to ensure the overload is necessary\nand understand the workload and financial implications. Credit overload\napprovals will be based on prior academic performance and necessity.\nPASS/FAIL\u00a0\nThe privilege of electing courses on a pass/fail basis is extended to\nundergraduate students in the school. Students who are in good academic\nstanding (not on probation) may elect one course on a pass/fail basis\nper term. The summer sessions collectively count as one term. A course\ntaken pass/fail must be an elective. A student may not take a required\ncourse or a prerequisite to a required course under this privilege. A\nmaximum of 16 pass/fail credits may be counted toward a BS degree\nfrom the School of Human Ecology.\u00a0Courses taken pass/fail will count\ntoward degree credits but will be excluded in the computation of\ngrade point average and honors.\nRequests to take a course under the pass/fail privilege are initiated\nthrough the Course Change Request in the MyUW (http://my.wisc.edu)\nStudent Center and must be elected by the noted enrollment Dates and\nDeadlines (https://registrar.wisc.edu/dates/).

If you have any questions, please\ncontact the department.\nWHAT IS IT ABOUT?\nHoused in the School of Human Ecology, this 18-credit certificate in\nDesign Strategy provides undergraduate students from all majors with\na hands-on, interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving for strategic\nchange. Through applying Design Thinking techniques and exploring\nthe interconnections between people and built, natural, and financial\nenvironments, students will learn to put ideas into action and develop\nforward-thinking approaches to a variety of issues.\nWHAT IS DESIGN STRATEGY?\nDesign Strategy is a successful approach to problem-solving with a focus\non quality of life and sustainable futures. It begins with asking \"better\"\nquestions as a way to understand the root of the problem and why it is an\nissue. It is an empathetic, human-centered perspective that uses Design\nThinking and draws from historical precedence and current research from a\nvariety of fields to help solve complex and persistent problems.\nWHAT WILL STUDENTS GAIN?\nStudents acquire concrete methodologies that enable them to apply\nwhat they have learned in their degree studies in a way that goes beyond\nthe theoretical emphasis of most degree programs. Rather than adding\nadditional expertise and knowledge in a particular field, this certificate\ngives students ways to apply what they have learned in their majors to\nreal-world problems; in the process, they become confident and creative\nforward thinkers, who are able to work in interdisciplinary teams.\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nAdmissions to the Design Strategy Certificate have been\nsuspended as of fall 2024.

Next accreditation review: 2030.\nMATERIAL CULTURE\nSTUDIES, CERTIFICATE\nThe certificate in material culture studies has two interrelated goals. First,\nstudents will become acquainted with the field of material culture studies\nand its methodologies. They will learn what kinds of objects are considered\nin the study of material culture (from small, intimate artifacts of daily life\nto large cultural landscapes) and how scholars and professionals from\ndifferent fields and in different contexts enlist material culture in their\nresearch and activities. They will gain an appreciation for the information\nartifacts can provide. They will learn the kinds of questions that can be\nasked of objects and the kind of information that artifacts can show\nus. They will become familiar with (and able to distinguish between)\ndescriptive and interpretive components of material culture study and\ngain an awareness of the variety of methods. Second, students will gain an\nappreciation for the ways that \u201cthings\u201d help us to connect to the world and\nsee it in a new way, and the ways \u201cthings\u201d give meaning to our lives and the\nlives of those around us.\nHOW TO GET IN\nHOW TO GET IN\nAll undergraduate students in good academic standing are eligible to apply\nfor the Material Culture Studies Certificate. Connect with an Academic\nAdvisor (https://advising.humanecology.wisc.edu/) for application\ninformation and the October and February deadlines.\nStudents considering declaring the Art History Certificate as well as the\nMaterial Culture Certificate may complete both but only one course may\noverlap between the two certificates.\nREQUIREMENTS\nREQUIREMENTS\nThe Material Culture Studies Certificate requires 13 credits.\nStudents must earn a minimum 2.000 GPA on required certificate\ncoursework.

LIFE-PRACTICE AND CAREERS\nInterdisciplinary practice is central to material culture analysis. Significant\nengagement with material culture can have a noteworthy positive effect\non students from a wide range of majors in their preparation for future\ncareers. Understanding principles of design, analyzing the cultural\nmeaning of physical objects, and gaining knowledge of varied systems of\nmaking, distributing, and using artifacts and consumer goods throughout\nhistory are all broadly applicable learning outcomes. The curricula of\nthe 21st century often place extra value on science and technology, to\nthe detriment of the study of the arts and humanities. The Material\nCulture Program helps integrate these and other disparate spheres into a\nuniversity education. One undergraduate student summed it thus:\nI ended up being able to use what I learned in material culture for\nmy research in human computer interaction and design. I think\nhaving a background in material culture strengthened my skills as\na user experience designer (which is what I will be doing at Intel\nafter graduation).\nErica Lewis, 2016 \nUndergraduate certificate student \nEngineering/Materials Design\nOther material culture certificate holders have gone on to careers in\nmuseums, galleries, historic sites, historic preservation, digital media,\ndesign practice, universities, and business.

Nursing students\nare responsible for arranging their own transportation to and from their\nclinical sites. First-year clinicals are accessible by public transportation\nfrom Signe Skott Cooper Hall and other points in Madison. Second-\nyear clinicals require travel to and from an agency, as well as to and\nfrom homes, schools, and other sites. Locales may be up to 90 miles\nfrom Madison. Therefore, second-year nursing students are required\nto have (1) a valid driver\u2019s license, and (2) individual access to a car.\nStudents are responsible for all transportation costs incurred, including\ngas and parking fees. Students with extenuating circumstances that\nhave an impact on their clinical transportation options (e.g., driving/\nmedical restrictions) should use the Petition for Special Consideration\n(https://nursingstudentnet.wiscweb.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/\nsites/222/2017/07/petition-spec-consideration-ug.pdf) to request an\naccommodation or exception to the transportation policy.

The uniform consists of a white top and navy pants. The white\ntop, embroidered with the School of Nursing logo, is available in two styles\nand the pants will be available in three styles. Lab coats embroidered\nwith the school logo are also required and are worn when students are on\ntheir clinical units doing clinical preparation and during most community\nclinical experiences. In addition to the uniform requirements, there are also\nprofessional appearance guidelines (https://students.nursing.wisc.edu/\nclinicals-compliance/clinical-information/) for students.\nUnsafe Clinical Performance\nA student who demonstrates unsafe nursing practice that jeopardizes\nthe client's or family's physical or emotional welfare may be dismissed\nat any time from the clinical area. Unsafe clinical practice is defined\nas any behavior determined by faculty or a preceptor to be actually or\npotentially detrimental to the client or to the healthcare agency. Unsafe\nclinical practice can include behaviors related to physical or mental health\nproblems; use of alcohol, drugs, or chemicals; lack of preparation for\nclinical; or deficits in problem-solving skills. Reports of unsafe clinical\nperformance will be routed through the course professor and/or the\ncourse coordinator to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs who will\nwork with the faculty and student to determine the appropriate outcome,\nwhich may include\u00a0immediate removal from the course (i.e., administrative\ndrop) and subsequent implications for academic progression.\nStudent Invasive Procedures\nDuring clinical laboratory classes, experiential learning sessions, and/\nor or at any other time, students may not practice invasive procedures\non themselves, other students, faculty, preceptors, staff, and/or any\nother unauthorized individuals. This includes, but is not limited to, any\ninvasive procedures that require needles, syringes, and/or intravenous\nsupplies; nasogastric tube insertion; catheterization; etc. During some\nnon-invasive experiences, such as physical assessment, listening to a\nheartbeat, or taking a blood pressure, students may be asked to act as\npractice participants.

Students should not expect to be excused from required\ncoursework for personal/family events, work obligations, or because of\nnon-compliance with School of Nursing or clinical agency health and\nonboarding requirements. In extraordinary circumstances, an absence may\nbe granted at the discretion of the course instructor. This might include\nan absence due to personal crisis, military or civic obligation, authorized\nuniversity activity, religious observances, or health concerns that affect\nthe student\u2019s ability to safely care for patients. In most cases, students will\nbe required to provide documentation regarding the absence.\nDidactic Course Attendance\nIn most didactic courses, attendance and/or participation are factored\ninto the grading process. Absences may place students in jeopardy of not\nmeeting course learning outcomes and thus successfully completing the\ncourse. If this occurs, the instructor will consult with the Undergraduate\nProgram Director and/or the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs to\ndetermine the appropriate course of action, which may include being\nremoved (i.e., administratively dropped) from the course. Students should\nreview each course syllabus for specific policies related to absences in that\ncourse and make-up experiences, if applicable.\nExperiential Learning Attendance\nIt is the expectation that students attend all Experiential Learning\nactivities as clinical learning is essential to the completion of the nursing\nprogram. If a student must miss an Experiential Learning session due to\nan extraordinary circumstance, a decision as to whether the student will\nmake up the experience/hours will be based on the student\u2019s progress in\nmeeting course learning outcomes.

Students seeking reentry to the baccalaureate program who\nhave left on academic action must be reviewed by the Office of Academic\nAffairs. If readmission is granted, academic requirements may be specified\nto insure currency in nursing knowledge and skills prior to enrolling in\nclinical nursing courses. These requirements may include remediation and/\nor repetition of courses, depending on academic standing or length of\ntime since leaving the program. The remaining program will be planned as\nconsidered best for the student and according to the current curriculum.\nRetaking Courses\nEach individual required nursing course may be repeated only once with\na maximum of two repeated courses in the curriculum. Students who\ndo not successfully complete a course after two attempts or who must\nrepeat more than two different courses will be dis-enrolled from the\nnursing program. A course for which a student earned a grade below C (or\nNC in a clinical course) must be repeated within the next two semesters\nin residence. All grades earned will be used in calculating the student\u2019s\ncumulative and nursing grade point averages, but credits will be counted\nonly once toward the minimum nursing and degree credit requirements.\nDidactic/Theory Courses: Undergraduate students may repeat any\nrequired didactic/theory course once without special permission.\nClinical Courses: To repeat a clinical course, an appeal must be made to\nthe Associate Dean for Academic Affairs who will determine if the appeal\nmerits approval.

This can be carried out at the subcellular and molecular level, the\ncellular level, the tissue level, the organ level, or the whole-animal level.\nPharmacologists also are concerned with the development of new drugs\nthat produce fewer side effects while curing disease, and provide more\neffective and/or more rapid treatment of disease in humans or animals.\nToxicologists\u00a0find scientifically sound answers to questions about\nchemicals that may potentially threaten our health, about pesticides in\nthe food we eat, pollutants in the air we breathe, chemicals in the water\nwe drink, and toxic waste sites near our homes. Some toxicologists are\nconcerned with determining the cellular mechanisms by which drugs and\nchemicals produce toxic effects. Many are involved in subspecialty areas in\ntoxicology research, such as reproductive and developmental toxicology,\nneurotoxicology, immunotoxicology, and inhalation toxicology. Researchers\nin these areas utilize both laboratory animals and in vitro systems to\nexamine the cellular, biochemical, and molecular processes underlying\ntoxic responses.\nBS IN PHARMACEUTICAL\nSCIENCES\nThe BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences\u00a0is not a major\u00a0but is an internal\ndegree granted to current Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students after\nthey complete at least one year of the PharmD program.

This major covers two related biomedical\nsciences:\n\u2022 Pharmacology: The study of drug actions, including their sites,\nproperties, effects, and mechanisms.\n\u2022 Toxicology: The study of harmful effects of chemicals on humans and\nanimals, including exposure assessment, hazard identification, dose\nresponse, and risk characterization.\nBoth fields integrate various scientific disciplines and use advanced\nbiotechnological methods to understand drug and toxicant actions at\nthe molecular level. The curriculum is multidisciplinary, spanning several\nbiomedical sciences. This major can prepare students for a variety of\nfuture careers and paths, including graduate school in the biomedical\nsciences, health professions like medical or dental school, or to work in the\nbiotech or pharmaceutical industry.\nThe PharmTox major is a limited enrollment, selective admission major.\nAn application is required along with prerequisite courses - for details,\nsee How to Get In (p.\u00a01796). Pre-PharmTox students are usually enrolled\nin the College of Letters & Science or the College of Agricultural and\nLife Sciences during their first two years. Students should stay in contact\nwith the PharmTox advisor to keep up with admission requirements and\nprogram updates. Once admitted, the core curriculum takes two years to\ncomplete (typically junior and senior years).\nFor those interested in becoming pharmacists, information about the\nDoctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program is available here: https://\npharmacy.wisc.edu/programs/pharmd/.

Students interested\nin graduating in three years should meet with the PharmTox academic\nadvisor early and often to discuss feasibility, appropriate course\nsequencing, post-graduation plans (careers, graduate school, etc.), and\nother considerations.\nWhile there are many advantages to attending four years of college,\nincluding making the most of research and study abroad opportunities,\nexploring alternative majors, completing additional majors and certificates,\ndeveloping skills and interests through student groups, and personal\ngrowth, students may have various reasons for wanting to graduate in\nthree years, and the PharmTox advisor will work with students to help them\nprioritize their goals.\nThis example plan assumes that students will:\n\u2022 Enter their first year at UW-Madison with at least 25 advanced\nstanding credits (to be able to meet the PharmTox application\nprerequisite of 60 credits by the start of their second year), including\nequivalency credit for\u00a0 Introductory Biology (ZOOLOGY/BIOLOGY/\nBOTANY\u00a0\u00a0151)\u00a0.

Some\nterms may require more or less credits than the example plan,\ndepending on the number of advanced standing credits a student\nbrings in.\nSummer coursework will be required after the first year for students\nwithout chemistry advanced standing credits, in order to complete general\nand organic chemistry before the start of the second year.
